Perceptions and dilemmas around cyber-security in a Spanish research center after a cyber-attack,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00847-7,04 April 2024,"Joaquín Navajas-Adán, Eulàlia Badia-Gelabert, Laura Jiménez-Saurina, Mª Jesús Marijuán-Martín, Rafael Mayo-García","Information and Communication Technologies and Internet networks are present in all aspects of social reality and are essential elements in research, development and innovation centers (R&D&I). Cyber-security is crucial for the progress of the research activities developed in these centers, especially given the exponential growth of cyber-attacks and incidents. The present study aims to assess from a socio-technical approach, how a serious cyber-attack on a Spanish research center has affected staff’s perceptions of information and communication systems (ICT) security. This study employed a mixed-methods research strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of ICT security perceptions among employees. First a quantitative scale was administered to 1,321 employees 3 years before the cyber-attack and 4 months afterward, to measure ICT security perceptions. Then, qualitative techniques (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and micro-ethnography) were applied to gain a deeper understanding of the arguments underpinning cyber-security at the center after the attack. The results show that the event had an impact on employees’ perceptions, increasing the perceived importance of ICT security, with positive behavioral changes noted, but with doubts about their sustainability over time. Also, the need for cyber-security governance was critically contrasted with organizational reality. Finally, the compatibility of science and cyber-security was a central dilemma, which seems to confront antagonistic poles (research and security ICT) and justify the non-compliance with security protocols by part of the staff.",information communication technology internet network present aspect social reality essential element research development innovation center rdi cybersecurity crucial progress research activity developed center especially give exponential growth cyberattacks incident present study aim ass sociotechnical approach serious cyberattack spanish research center affected staff perception information communication system ict security study employ mixedmethods research strategy combine quantitative qualitative method provide comprehensive nuanced understand ict security perception among employee first quantitative scale administer employee year cyberattack month afterward measure ict security perception qualitative technique semistructured interview focus group microethnography apply gain deeper understand argument underpin cybersecurity center attack result show event impact employee perception increase perceive importance ict security positive behavioral change note doubt sustainability time also need cybersecurity governance critically contrast organizational reality finally compatibility science cybersecurity central dilemma seem confront antagonistic pole research security ict justify noncompliance security protocol part staff
Maritime decision-makers and cyber security: deck officers’ perception of cyber risks towards IT and OT systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00810-y,02 February 2024,"Marie Haugli-Sandvik, Mass Soldal Lund, Frøy Birte Bjørneseth","Through a quantitative study of deck officers’ cyber risk perceptions towards information (IT) and operational (OT) systems, this paper contributes to substantiate the importance of considering human behaviour within maritime cyber security. Using survey data from 293 deck officers working on offshore vessels, statistical analyses were conducted to measure and predict the participants cyber risk perceptions towards IT and OT systems. Performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a significant discrepancy in the levels of cyber risk perception between the system categories. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to develop statistical models, considering multiple independent variables, including perceived benefit, cyber security training, experience with cyber-attacks, and trust towards various stakeholders. Key findings revealed distinct results for IT and OT systems, and the regression models varied in both predictive power and significance of the independent variables. Perceived benefit positively predicts deck officers cyber risk perception for both IT and OT systems, while trust, which included measures of social trust and confidence, was not found to be significant. Cyber security training and experience with cyber-attacks only influence deck officers’ perception of cyber risks related to operational technology. Practical implications of this work provide actionable recommendations for the maritime industry, including tailored risk communication tools, training programs, reporting systems, and holistic policies.",quantitative study deck officer cyber risk perception towards information operational ot system paper contributes substantiate importance consider human behaviour within maritime cyber security use survey data deck officer work offshore vessel statistical analysis conduct measure predict participant cyber risk perception towards ot system perform wilcoxon signedrank test reveal significant discrepancy level cyber risk perception system category hierarchical regression analysis conduct develop statistical model consider multiple independent variable include perceive benefit cyber security training experience cyberattacks trust towards various stakeholder key finding reveal distinct result ot system regression model varied predictive power significance independent variable perceive benefit positively predicts deck officer cyber risk perception ot system trust include measure social trust confidence found significant cyber security training experience cyberattacks influence deck officer perception cyber risk related operational technology practical implication work provide actionable recommendation maritime industry include tailor risk communication tool training program reporting system holistic policy

A modular cyber security training programme for the maritime domain,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00799-4,03 January 2024,"Aybars Oruc, Nabin Chowdhury, Vasileios Gkioulos","The global maritime industry is continuing the rapid digitization of systems and dependency on advancing technology, in a trend akin to other industrial domains. One of the main issues that this integration has brought is an increased vulnerability to a growing number of cyber threats. While several security measures are being implemented to prevent or respond to cyber attacks, the human element is still one of the main weaknesses. Many of today’s cyber attacks take advantage of human personnel’s lack of awareness, which makes cyber security awareness and training activities of critical importance. Unfortunately, current research is still limited in its offerings for cyber security training specific to maritime personnel. Moreover, such training programmes for the professionals should be developed role-based in accordance with the suggestions of many credited maritime organizations. For this reason, we developed a modular cyber security training programme for the maritime domain called Maritime Cyber Security (MarCy) by implementing Critical Events Model (CEM). Then, we evaluated the MarCy programme by utilizing the Delphi technique with the participation of 19 experts from academia and industry. In this study, we offer cyber security training for seafarers and office employees in shipping companies. We proposed eleven elective modules to improve the knowledge, skills, and attitude of learners against cyber risks. The MarCy programme can be implemented by universities, shipping companies, training institutes, and governmental organizations for maritime cyber security training purposes.",global maritime industry continue rapid digitization system dependency advance technology trend akin industrial domain one main issue integration brought increase vulnerability grow number cyber threat several security measure implement prevent respond cyber attack human element still one main weakness many today cyber attack take advantage human personnel lack awareness make cyber security awareness training activity critical importance unfortunately current research still limited offering cyber security training specific maritime personnel moreover training programme professional developed rolebased accordance suggestion many credit maritime organization reason developed modular cyber security training programme maritime domain call maritime cyber security marcy implement critical event model cem evaluate marcy programme utilize delphi technique participation expert academia industry study offer cyber security training seafarer office employee shipping company propose eleven elective module improve knowledge skill attitude learner cyber risk marcy programme implement university shipping company training institute governmental organization maritime cyber security training purpose

The usage and implementation of information systems has offered new opportunities while also introducing new types of risk. Cyber security is one of the most significant challenges that maritime information systems have faced. These most recent changes and technological developments necessitate the identification of new competencies and skillsets in order for seafarers to take steps to protect themselves and the assets they are responsible for against the consequences of cyber-attacks. The present study is aimed at determining the future skill requirements for maritime cyber security to fulfill the inconsistencies between current and actual marine transportation demands. In the paper, the skill requirements for cyber security are comprehensively analyzed in terms of information and operational technology implementations and their regulatory requirements. The AHP technique is then used to establish the priorities of three categories as well as the skills within each category. Considering the strong relations between seafarer training and maritime safety, determining future skill requirements will improve overall maritime safety and security.

Aiming at strengthening cyber security education and research that utilize well designed CRs, we first analyze the CRs domain to identify key characteristics, strengths and fundamental weaknesses, and based on these outcomes we propose the Cyber Range Design Framework (CRDF), which includes the CR Architecture and the CR Life-Cycle. The CR Architecture presents the main components of CRDF compliant CRs, whereas the CR Life-Cycle presents the development phases of such approaches and the activities these phases embrace. CRDF builds on the Conceptual Framework for eLearning and Training (COFELET) and on the Exercise Life-Cycle. COFELET is particularly elaborated for the development of cyber security educational approaches, by adopting its design considerations that were based on widely adopted educational theories and approaches (e.g., scenario-based, reuse of elements). CRDF envisages the elaboration of CRs which optimize their impact, mitigate their weaknesses, and minimize their preparation and running costs. Under this prism, a preliminary appreciation of the CRDF approaches effectiveness is presented along with the expected outcomes of such approaches.",need effective training cyber security personnel work critical infrastructure corporate brought attention evolution cyber range cr learn training tool although cr organize many year lack standard common methodology facilitate development optimize effectiveness aim strengthen cyber security education research utilize well design cr first analyze cr domain identify key characteristic strength fundamental weakness base outcome propose cyber range design framework crdf include cr architecture cr lifecycle cr architecture present main component crdf compliant cr whereas cr lifecycle present development phase approach activity phase embrace crdf build conceptual framework elearning training cofelet exercise lifecycle cofelet particularly elaborate development cyber security educational approach adopt design consideration base widely adopt educational theory approach eg scenariobased reuse element crdf envisages elaboration cr optimize impact mitigate weakness minimize preparation run cost prism preliminary appreciation crdf approach effectiveness present along expect outcome approach

The paper philosophically argues for the importance of cyber-security and cybercrime awareness in fostering sustainable human development through the responsible and meaningful use of ICT. Using the overarching values of the human development framework (empowerment, participation and sustainability), the paper assesses government ICT policy documents and subsequent initiatives such as the establishment of community information centres and integration of ICT in the education sector. This was done to establish the extent to which citizens have been provided with prerequisite knowledge and skills to deal with cyber-crime. It emerged from the study that regardless of the effort by the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) to enforce a law which encourage a cyber-security culture, awareness about cyber-security remains far below what can be expected in a cyber-world. As a result, if citizens’ lack cyber knowledge their freedom to be and do what they reasonably value on the Internet is continually threatened. The paper, thus, suggests the introduction of rigorous citizens’ awareness campaigns on cyber-crime and security to enable them to deal with unfounded fears and experiences that potentially limit their ability to deliberate, transact or act to be and freely do what they reasonably value.",focus citizen awareness cybersecurity paper contributes debate icts contribution towards human development paper philosophically argues importance cybersecurity cybercrime awareness foster sustainable human development responsible meaningful use ict use overarch value human development framework empowerment participation sustainability paper ass government ict policy document subsequent initiative establishment community information centre integration ict education sector do establish extent citizen provide prerequisite knowledge skill deal cybercrime emerge study regardless effort government zimbabwe goz enforce law encourage cybersecurity culture awareness cybersecurity remains far expect cyberworld result citizen lack cyber knowledge freedom reasonably value internet continually threaten paper thus suggests introduction rigorous citizen awareness campaign cybercrime security enable deal unfounded fear experience potentially limit ability deliberate transact act freely reasonably value
Analysis of cyber security knowledge gaps based on cyber security body of knowledge,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-022-11261-8,05 August 2022,"Cagatay Catal, Alper Ozcan, Emrah Donmez, Ahmet Kasif","Due to the increasing number of cyber incidents and overwhelming skills shortage, it is required to evaluate the knowledge gap between cyber security education and industrial needs. As such, the objective of this study is to identify the knowledge gaps in cyber security graduates who join the cyber security workforce. We designed and performed an opinion survey by using the Cyber Security Knowledge Areas (KAs) specified in the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) that comprises 19 KAs. Our data was gathered from practitioners who work in cyber security organizations. The knowledge gap was measured and evaluated by acknowledging the assumption for employing sequent data as nominal data and improved it by deploying chi-squared test. Analyses demonstrate that there is a gap that can be utilized to enhance the quality of education. According to acquired final results, three key KAs with the highest knowledge gap are Web and Mobile Security, Security Operations and Incident Management. Also, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Software Lifecycles, and Vulnerabilities are the knowledge areas with largest difference in perception of importance between less and more experienced personnel. We discuss several suggestions to improve the cyber security curriculum in order to minimize the knowledge gaps. There is an expanding demand for executive cyber security personnel in industry. High-quality university education is required to improve the qualification of upcoming workforce. The capability and capacity of the national cyber security workforce is crucial for nations and security organizations. A wide range of skills, namely technical skills, implementation skills, management skills, and soft skills are required in new cyber security graduates.

To date, the dominant themes in interventions have been around personal deterrence (i.e. the threat of legal action) and have not considered other factors that may influence an individual’s decision to consume infringing content. In this paper, we consider psychological factors, including perceptions around risk-taking, security behaviours, problematic internet use and personality traits, to gain a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing engagement with IPTV and the potential implications for cyber security. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with 283 participants living in the UK (age range 18–74, male 104), and an integrated structural equation model was constructed. Our findings showed a positive relationship between security behaviours and the perceived risk of viewing IPTV and a negative relationship between the dark personality triad and the perceived risk of viewing IPTV. They suggest that security behaviours fully mediate the relationship between problematic internet use and IPTV risk-taking, indicating a potential new path for anti-piracy interventions with greater efficacy.",spur rapid modernisation sector advent internet protocol television iptv audiovisual av piracy epidemic level intervention limited effect date dominant theme intervention around personal deterrence ie threat legal action consider factor may influence individual decision consume infringe content paper consider psychological factor include perception around risktaking security behaviour problematic internet use personality trait gain comprehensive understand factor influence engagement iptv potential implication cyber security purpose survey conduct participant living uk age range male integrate structural equation model construct finding show positive relationship security behaviour perceive risk view iptv negative relationship dark personality triad perceive risk view iptv suggest security behaviour fully mediate relationship problematic internet use iptv risktaking indicate potential new path antipiracy intervention great efficacy

Through time-series modeling of security data, such as event logs, alerts, or incidents, analysts take a step towards these goals. On the one hand, extrapolating time-series to predict future occurrences of attacks and vulnerabilities is able to support decision-making and preparation against threats. On the other hand, detection of model deviations as anomalies can point to suspicious outliers and thereby disclose cyber attacks. However, since the set of available techniques for time-series analysis is just as diverse as the research domains in the area of cyber security analytics, it can be difficult for analysts to understand which approaches fit the properties of security data at hand. This paper therefore conducts a broad literature review in research domains that leverage time-series analysis for cyber security analytics, with focus on available techniques, data sets, and challenges imposed by applications or feature properties. The results of our study indicate that relevant approaches range from detective systems ingesting short-term and low-level events to models that produce long-term forecasts of high-level attack cases.",understand current threat landscape well timely detection imminent attack primary objective cyber security timeseries model security data event log alert incident analyst take step towards goal one hand extrapolate timeseries predict future occurrence attack vulnerability able support decisionmaking preparation threat hand detection model deviation anomaly point suspicious outlier thereby disclose cyber attack however since set available technique timeseries analysis diverse research domain area cyber security analytics difficult analyst understand approach fit property security data hand paper therefore conduct broad literature review research domain leverage timeseries analysis cyber security analytics focus available technique data set challenge impose application feature property result study indicate relevant approach range detective system ingest shortterm lowlevel event model produce longterm forecast highlevel attack case

We point to the potential cyber security risks companies are exposed to when rushing to adopt generative AI solutions or buying into “AI hype”. While the benefits of implementing generative AI solutions for business have been widely touted, the inherent risks associated have been less well publicised. There are growing concerns that the race to integrate generative AI is not being accompanied by adequate safety measures. The rush to buy into the hype of generative AI and not fall behind the competition is potentially exposing companies to broad and possibly catastrophic cyber-attacks or breaches. In this paper, we outline significant cyber security threats generative AI models pose, including potential ‘backdoors’ in AI models that could compromise user data or the risk of ‘poisoned’ AI models producing false results. In light of these the cyber security concerns, we discuss the moral obligations of implementing generative AI into business by considering the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We identify two examples of ethical concern,overrelianceandover-trustin generative AI, both of which can negatively influence business decisions, leaving companies vulnerable to cyber security threats.

Suresh Kumar, Osamah Ibrahim Khalaf, Radha Raman Chandan, Qusay Bsoul, Shashi Kant Gupta, Firas Zawaideh, Deema Mohammed Alsekait, Diaa Salama AbdElminaam","Robust verification protocols are crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of sensitive information due to the increasing complexity of cyber-attacks. This paper introduces a novel 5G Secure Handover Protocol aimed at addressing security and effectiveness issues encountered in existing systems. The proposed protocol is robust against various attacks, including de-synchronization, replay, man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of services (DoS), and jamming, ensures perfect forward key secrecy, safeguarding communication confidentiality. The proposed protocol utilizes a combination of spiking neural network and fuzzy logic (SNN-FL) techniques that must choose the goal cell as carefully as possible before initiating the transfer process. By combining fuzzy logic and spiking neural networks to reduce handover latency and thwart several types of cyberattacks, the proposed 5G Secure Handover Protocol improves security. Extensive simulations show its efficacy and emphasize its potential for safe communication in large-scale cybersecurity applications.

The LeWiS Method: Target Variable Estimation Using Cyber Security Intelligence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-024-02744-1,18 April 2024,"Leigh Chase, Alaa Mohasseb, Benjamin Aziz","Information technology plays an increasingly important role in the provision of essential services. For these systems and networks to be reliable and trustworthy, we must defend them from those who would seek to compromise their confidentiality, integrity and availability. Security intelligence tells us about the tactics, techniques and procedures used by threat actors for these very purposes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for learning malicious behaviours and then estimating how likely it is that a system has been compromised. One of the difficulties encountered when applying machine learning to cyber security, is the lack of ground truth on which to train supervised techniques. This is often compounded by the volume, variety and velocity of data which is far greater than can be processed using only human analyses. The technique known as LeWiS, created and described by the authors, includes data preparation and processing phases that learn and later predict the presence of threat actors using a model of their behaviours. The method addresses the problems of scale and veracity, by learning indicators of attack via feature extraction from security intelligence that has been obtained through empirical methods. This approach shows promising classification performance for detecting learned malicious behaviours, within synthesised systems’ event data.",information technology play increasingly important role provision essential service system network reliable trustworthy must defend would seek compromise confidentiality integrity availability security intelligence tell u tactic technique procedure use threat actor purpose paper introduce novel method learn malicious behaviour estimate likely system compromise one difficulty encounter apply machine learn cyber security lack ground truth train supervise technique often compound volume variety velocity data far great process use human analysis technique know lewis create described author include data preparation processing phase learn later predict presence threat actor use model behaviour method address problem scale veracity learn indicator attack via feature extraction security intelligence obtain empirical method approach show promising classification performance detect learn malicious behaviour within synthesise system event data

Firms and their staff are experiencing mass phishing attacks, several typical precursors to more sinister attacks like cyber-enabled fraud, ransomware, and denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Threat actors are leveraging new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver sophisticated scam and phishing messages that are challenging for users to identify as malicious. Several businesses are increasing technical efforts in critical areas, including network hardening, robust patching, anti-malware, ransomware detection applications, and multi-factor authentication to detect, prevent, and recover from potential threats. Despite that, these measures provide only a partial solution if the users who access the systems do not have good security awareness training. In this study, we review some cyber risks related to remote working and detail how they can be remediated through regular security awareness education campaigns (SAECs). The study presents the results of a proof of concept (PoC) experiment conducted to establish the value of regular SAECs in the fight against scams and phishing attacks against remote workers. The pilot results confirm that securing the remote office requires a robust SAEC. It argues that to be successful and help staff protect business systems and data, SAECs must be regular and varied, providing opportunities for staff to understand what to look for in suspicious scams and phishing emails. Moreover, they must provide opportunities for staff to practice their knowledge and understanding through practical exercises such as spam and phishing simulation exercises, which could help users avoid falling victim to spam and phishing emails.",cyber security threat include risk remote worker varied diverse number scam business email compromise breach increase firm staff experience mass phishing attack several typical precursor sinister attack like cyberenabled fraud ransomware denial service ddos attack threat actor leverage new technology machine learn artificial intelligence ai deliver sophisticated scam phishing message challenge user identify malicious several business increase technical effort critical area include network harden robust patch antimalware ransomware detection application multifactor authentication detect prevent recover potential threat despite measure provide partial solution user access system good security awareness training study review cyber risk related remote work detail remediate regular security awareness education campaign saecs study present result proof concept poc experiment conduct establish value regular saecs fight scam phishing attack remote worker pilot result confirm secure remote office require robust saec argues successful help staff protect business system data saecs must regular varied provide opportunity staff understand look suspicious scam phishing email moreover must provide opportunity staff practice knowledge understand practical exercise spam phishing simulation exercise could help user avoid fall victim spam phishing email

Several criticisms were raised against current CS training offerings, which often made them inadequate, or unable to change participants’ behavior and security attitude. One of the main factors CS training programs are often not very effective is the lack of engagement or motivation of participants. This is often the result of training not being tailored to the needs or preferences of participants. In our previous work, we tackled this issue by developing a personalized learning theory-based model for developing CS training frameworks. In this work, we utilize the model to develop two CS training exercises: two game-based scenarios using the CS training video game Cyber CIEGE and one table-top team exercise. The exercises are later tested by involving a group of 12 students from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU) Information Security master’s degree program. According to the results of the experiment and the feedback from the students, students felt more engaged during the exercises due to having been participants in their development process.

However, there are significant challenges facing healthcare organizations in retrieving patient data from databases and ensuring the security and privacy of this data. Addressing these challenges is vital to the future success of the healthcare industry. This paper proposes two solutions to these challenges: a simplified ontology-based retrieval algorithm for healthcare multimedia data to enhance the retrieval process, and Hierarchical learning: ensemble model-based reinforcement learning to improve patient data security. An ontology-based retrieval algorithm was a method used to retrieve relevant information from large datasets. It filtered out irrelevant data and provided contextually relevant results. Hierarchical learning involved organizing learning tasks in a hierarchical structure, with higher-level policies guiding lower-level policies. Ensemble model-based reinforcement learning combined multiple models to improve the performance of a reinforcement learning system. The Simplified Ontology-Based Retrieval Algorithm had excellent performance with an accuracy of 92%, making it highly effective in information retrieval tasks.

Due to attack cost restrictions, the linked channels are subject to a limit on the number of continuous DoS attacks. A proactive security control method is then developed to combat two-channel DoS attacks, depending on a method for identifying IoT intrusions. Using the CICIDS dataset for attack detection, we examined the effectiveness of the Deep Convolutional Network Model (DCNM), a suggested deep learning model. The addressed CPS can be asymptotically stable against DoS assaults under the security controller's active security control technique without sacrificing control performance. Recent tests and simulations show how effective the security control strategy is active.

Alsulami, Qasem Abu Al-Haija, Badraddin Alturki, Ali Alqahtani, Raed Alsini","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are emergent systems that enable effective real-time communication and collaboration (C&C) of physical components such as control systems, sensors, actuators, and the surrounding environment through a cyber communication infrastructure. As such, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the fields that have significantly adopted the CPS approach to improving people's lives in smart cities by reducing energy consumption and air pollution. Therefore, autonomous vehicle-cyber physical systems (AV-CPSs) have attracted enormous investments from major corporations and are projected to be widely used. However, AV-CPS is vulnerable to cyber and physical threat vectors due to the deep integration of information technology (IT), including cloud computing, with the communication process. Cloud computing is critical in providing the scalable infrastructure required for real-time data processing, storage, and analysis in AV-CPS, allowing these systems to work seamlessly in smart cities. CPS components such as sensors and control systems through network infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks targeted by attackers using the communication system. This paper proposes an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) for AV-CPS using transfer learning to identify cyberattacks launched against connected physical components of AVs through a network infrastructure. First, AV-CPS was developed by implementing the controller area network (CAN) and integrating it into the AV simulation model. Second, the dataset was generated from the AV-CPS. The collected dataset was then preprocessed to be trained and tested via pre-trained CNNs. Third, eight pre-trained networks were implemented, namely, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet.

The number and diversity of such attacks against Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasing at impressive rates. In times of Industry 4.0 and Cyber-Physical Systems, providing security against cyber-physical attacks is a serious challenge which calls for cybersecurity risk assessment methods capable of investigating the tight interactions and interdependencies between the cyber and the physical components in such systems. However, existing risk assessment methods do not consider this specific characteristic of CPSs. In this paper, we propose a dependency-based, domain-agnostic cybersecurity risk assessment method that leverages a model of the CPS under study that captures dependencies among the system components. The proposed method identifies possible attack paths against critical components of a CPS by taking an attacker’s viewpoint and prioritizes these paths according to their risk to materialize, thus allowing the defenders to define efficient security controls. We illustrate the workings of the proposed method by applying it to a case study of a CPS in the energy domain, and we highlight the advantages that the proposed method offers when used to assess cybersecurity risks in CPSs.",cyberphysical attack security breach cyber space impact physical environment number diversity attack cyberphysical system cps increase impressive rate time industry cyberphysical system provide security cyberphysical attack serious challenge call cybersecurity risk assessment method capable investigate tight interaction interdependency cyber physical component system however exist risk assessment method consider specific characteristic cps paper propose dependencybased domainagnostic cybersecurity risk assessment method leverage model cps study capture dependency among system component propose method identifies possible attack path critical component cps take attacker viewpoint prioritizes path accord risk materialize thus allow defender define efficient security control illustrate working propose method apply case study cps energy domain highlight advantage propose method offer use ass cybersecurity risk cps

This study aims to improve the identification and mitigation of cyber risks in these systems by introducing the Socio-Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) architecture. The suggested SCPS framework combines social behaviour analytics, physical network monitoring, and powerful artificial intelligence to establish a comprehensive and flexible security system. The proposed method processes the brand marketing area, such as Alluring ads, and the SCPS helps to identify the cyber-attacks in ads. Initially, it collects the URL structure dataset and pre-processes the data. Then, the SCPS is integrated with the system to identify any attacks in the URL dataset. Next, the dataset will be trained using deep learning methods such as Deep Maxout Network (DMN). An experimental setup in a fictitious brand communication network shows how well the system recognises and reacts to different types of cyberattacks. The SCPS framework is a new strategy that contributes to digital marketing administration and cyber security by bringing together the social, technological, and physical domains to protect digital marketing assets. The evaluation of the trial showed effective and precise detection of phishing attacks. According to the performance evaluation, the DMN algorithm beat other applied models with a maximum accuracy and precision of 96% during the training and 93% during the testing phases. Based on URL, text, and image attributes, the algorithms distinguished between phishing and authentic websites with these precision values.

In this work, the hybrid cyber attack is addressed, which contains deception attacks and DoS attacks. It is anticipated that input control signals sent across a network are vulnerable to hybrid cyber-attacks in which adversaries could inject fake data into the control signals. Since system state information is usually not fully known, an observer-based controller is built to stabilize the system and keep the right performance index even when hybrid cyber-attacks happen. By solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the controllers and observers are also obtained.

In this paper, we design an approach and a data model that enable to ingest and store the essential information from disparate organizational units and act as a basis for the flexible creation of cyber security reports. We describe the application of this approach and model in a case study together with the Austrian Ministry of Defense (MoD), in which we surveyed existing data sources and transfer paths and rated the applicability of the CCOP data model and accompanying processes in course of a proof-of-concept implementation.",numerous cyber situational awareness model propose recent year yet one main challenge still remains mostly unsolved information source contribute process establish cyber situational awareness relevant information collect previous scientific work focus situational awareness model decision support base common operating picture ingest maintain consistent data basis cyber domain rarely study detail however crucial data distribute across different system need collect vet correlate deduplicated enrich finally store basis flexible cyber security reporting paper design approach data model enable ingest store essential information disparate organizational unit act basis flexible creation cyber security report describe application approach model case study together austrian ministry defense mod survey exist data source transfer path rat applicability ccop data model accompany process course proofofconcept implementation

Proposed cancelable biometrics system based on hybrid optical crypto-steganography audio framework for cyber security applications,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-18232-w,08 July 2024,Mai Helmy,"Biometric authentication systems have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their high level of security and convenience. Cancelable biometrics is a promising area of research that addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with traditional biometric systems. By transforming the biometric data in a non-invertible manner, cancelable biometrics offer enhanced privacy protection, increased security, and the flexibility to revoke or update biometric templates. As research in this field continues to advance, cancelable biometrics has the potential to revolutionize the way biometric systems are implemented and utilized. Ten years ago, there is a dire need to develop new cancelable biometric systems depending on cryptography or steganography system which may merging the two previous techniques to hide secret information within a cover medium. It involves encrypting the message and then embedding it into an innocent-looking file, such as an image or audio file. The goal is to make the hidden message undetectable to anyone who is not the intended recipient. This method ensures that even if the cover medium is intercepted, the secret information remains secure. Crypto-steganography is a powerful tool for covert communication and has applications in various fields, including intelligence agencies, cyber-security, and digital multimedia applications. In a classical cryptography system, users can easily change their password if they are compromised. However, user's biometrics is limited and unique, and if they are compromised, it will be impossible to change them as it in cryptography system. So, the basic concept of cancelable biometrics is to use another version of the original biometric template created through a one-way transform or a crypto-steganography scheme to keep the original biometrics safe and away from utilization in the system. Cancelable biometrics depends on the transformation of data so that users can replace their single biometric template in the same or different system. In this paper, a biometric system is presented as a novel hybrid optical crypto-steganography algorithm which is used to achieve cancelability option over audios signal. A proposal hybrid crypto-steganography technique based on the optical Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE) algorithm which is suggested to attain simultaneous encryption of multi-audios, begins with encrypting the biometric audios using the optical DRPE algorithm, then the resulting encrypted biometric audios are further encrypted again with the chaotic Baker map as a permutation strategy, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and Ron's Code (RC6) as a diffusion strategy. Then, the resulting encrypted biometrics is embedded into the cover media with a steganography technique which is based on a chaotic concept. Finally, the quality evaluation of the proposed cancelable biometrics system reveals good performance. The simulation results prove that the suggested hybrid optical crypto-steganography framework is reliable and presents recommended security and robustness levels for its utilization in achieving efficient cancelable biometrics systems compared to traditional techniques.",biometric authentication system gain significant popularity recent year due high level security convenience cancelable biometrics promising area research address privacy security concern associate traditional biometric system transform biometric data noninvertible manner cancelable biometrics offer enhance privacy protection increase security flexibility revoke update biometric template research field continue advance cancelable biometrics potential revolutionize way biometric system implement utilized ten year ago dire need develop new cancelable biometric system depend cryptography steganography system may merge two previous technique hide secret information within cover medium involves encrypt message embed innocentlooking file image audio file goal make hidden message undetectable anyone intend recipient method ensures even cover medium intercept secret information remains secure cryptosteganography powerful tool covert communication application various field include intelligence agency cybersecurity digital multimedia application classical cryptography system user easily change password compromise however user biometrics limited unique compromise impossible change cryptography system basic concept cancelable biometrics use another version original biometric template create oneway transform cryptosteganography scheme keep original biometrics safe away utilization system cancelable biometrics depends transformation data user replace single biometric template different system paper biometric system present novel hybrid optical cryptosteganography algorithm use achieve cancelability option audio signal proposal hybrid cryptosteganography technique base optical double random phase encode drpe algorithm suggest attain simultaneous encryption multiaudios begin encrypt biometric audio use optical drpe algorithm result encrypt biometric audio encrypt chaotic baker map permutation strategy advanced encryption standard aes ron code rc diffusion strategy result encrypt biometrics embed cover medium steganography technique base chaotic concept finally quality evaluation propose cancelable biometrics system reveals good performance simulation result prove suggest hybrid optical cryptosteganography framework reliable present recommend security robustness level utilization achieve efficient cancelable biometrics system compare traditional technique

We develop a stylized game-theoretic model and conduct a comparative analysis to investigate firms’ equilibrium decisions. Numerical studies are also performed to validate our results. Our findings reveal that setting a higher IoT functionality level benefits manufacturers through enhanced cyber-defense. Additionally, even when the cost of cyber-defense improvement is negligible, platforms may not economically benefit from such improvements if the unit penalty is high and defense efforts are low. Finally, we find that cyber-defense improvements can generate a win-win outcome for manufacturers, platforms, and consumers when defense efforts are high and the cost of improvement is low. Our results suggest that manufacturers should invest more in IoT when cyber-security risks are effectively mitigated.

The input parameters of the model are the flow intensities of typed cyber-physical attacks, the flow intensities of possible cyber-immune reactions, and the set of probabilities of neutralization of cyber-physical attacks. The set of admissible states of the info-communication system is described taking into account possible variants of the development of the modeled process. The initial parameters of the model are the probabilities of the studied system in the appropriate states at a particular moment. The dynamics of the info-communication system's life cycle are embodied in the form of a matrix of transient probabilities. The mentioned matrix connects the initial parameters in the form of a system of Chapman's equations. The article presents a computationally efficient concept based on Gershgorin's theorems to solve such a system of equations with given initiating values. Based on the presented scientific results, the article proposes the concept of calculating the time to failure as an indicator of the reliability of the info-communication system operating under the probable impact of typical cyber-physical attacks.

Using Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) methods whereas they are limited to validating user behaviors. Like high false positive rates, attack reoccurrence, and increases in numerous attacks. To overcome this problem, we use explainable (DL) techniques to increase cyber security in an IoT-enabled smart organization environment.

Thirdly, employed the explainable DQN-A3C model and the Siamese Inter Lingual Transformer (SILT) transformer for natural language explanations to boost social engineering security by ensuring the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model and human trustworthiness. After, we built a Hopping Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS/IPS) using an explainable Harmonized Google Net (HGN) model with SHAP and SILT explanations to appropriately categorize dangerous external traffic flows.

This becomes a problem when handling Machine Learning (ML) tasks to improve the system’s intrusion detection ability. This paper presents a novel solution by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create balanced datasets. Unlike traditional methods, our approach generates high-quality synthetic samples that maintain the intricate characteristics of the data, making it possible to improve detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce three specialized IDSs designed to detect attacks on the lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, utilizing hybrid Deep Learning (DL) algorithms (CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-GRU). Experimental results, using a combination of both the original MQTT dataset and a newly generated dataset through GANs, demonstrate the better performance of the generated datasets in multi-class classification. This performance highlights the effectiveness of our GAN-based approach in improving detection accuracy at the same time that it reduces false positives.

A collaboration of smart cities with autonomous vehicles shows the development towards a more advanced future. Cyber-physical system (CPS) are used blend the cyber and physical world, combined with electronic and mechanical systems, Autonomous vehicles (AVs) provide an ideal model of CPS. The integration of 6G technology with Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) marks a significant advancement in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), offering enhanced self-sufficiency, intelligence, and effectiveness. Autonomous vehicles rely on a complex network of sensors, cameras, and software to operate. A cyber-attack could interfere with these systems, leading to accidents, injuries, or fatalities. Autonomous vehicles are often connected to broader transportation networks and infrastructure. A successful cyber-attack could disrupt not only individual vehicles but also public transportation systems, causing widespread chaos and economic damage. Autonomous vehicles communicate with other vehicles (V2V) and infrastructure (V2I) for safe and efficient operation. If these communication channels are compromised, it could lead to collisions, traffic jams, or other dangerous situations. So we present a novel approach to mitigating these security risks by leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for dynamic cyber-attack detection within the cyber-physical systems (CPS) framework of AVs. The proposed Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IIDS) employs a combination of advanced learning techniques, including Data Fusion, One-Class Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor, to improve detection accuracy. The study demonstrates that the EfficientNet model achieves superior performance with an accuracy of up to 99.97%, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance the security of AV networks.

There are several incident response frameworks and approaches that an organization can implement to enhance its security posture. Usually, these will address specific adverse events such as computer security incidents, which in turn are limited in scope and coverage, typically within an organization. Nations have made limited effort in confronting severe cyber-attacks targeting and/or threatening them, as well as in preventing these attacks from being launched.

In this game the attacker and the defender choose how to distribute their resources in attacking or defending the different information assets. Given these investments the probability that an attack on a given asset is successful is an increasing function of the attacker’s investment and a decreasing function of the defender’s investment. The defender tries to minimize the expected damage from the attacks plus the cost of the defense while the attacker tries to maximize the expected damage from attacks minus his attacks’ expenses. The attacker is constrained by a budget. We compare two scenarios: a sequential move game and a simultaneous game. In the sequential game the defender moves first by deciding how much resources to allocate to the defense of each information asset and the attacker observes these investments and responds by allocating his resources in a manner that maximizes his expected utility. In the simultaneous game the attacker does not observe the defender’s decision before making his own. We analyze the best response strategies of the players and the equilibria of each of these games. Based on this analysis, we provide a tight upper bound on the reduction in defender’s costs that can be achieved by moving from the simultaneous to the sequential game.",study cyber security game defender wish defend information asset attacker try attack game attacker defender choose distribute resource attack defend different information asset give investment probability attack give asset successful increase function attacker investment decrease function defender investment defender try minimize expect damage attack plus cost defense attacker try maximize expect damage attack minus attack expense attacker constrain budget compare two scenario sequential move game simultaneous game sequential game defender move first decide much resource allocate defense information asset attacker observes investment responds allocate resource manner maximizes expect utility simultaneous game attacker observe defender decision make analyze best response strategy player equilibrium game base analysis provide tight upper bound reduction defender cost achieve move simultaneous sequential game

WSN are viewed as problematic networks because of the environments in which they may operate and the technology they rely on. For instance, routing protocols need to be prepared for and capable of recovering from unexpected events like node failures and packet losses. The dynamic nature of these routing environments necessitates that every WSN routing protocol have mechanisms for adapting to new conditions. In many applications, security affects performance and energy efficiency. To provide such security services, we require resilient key management techniques. Security Power Aware Routing-Salp Swarm Optimization (SPAR-SSO) protocol uses a unique cryptosystem. SPAR-SSO uses connection quality estimation and power aware routing to reduce power consumption and delay while increasing packet delivery ratio. WSNs must conserve energy because the nodes are battery-powered. If the route with the greatest energy savings is constantly chosen for delivery, the nodes along this route will be overused and drained quickly, leading to network partitioning. In SPAR-SSO, an optimal path to the sink node is chosen. This technology is interesting because to its ease in enterprise and tractability in network transportation administration to deliver integrated services. It delivers a collision-free medium and minimizes entire energy expended in attainment the terminus, dropping energy each unit or packet.

Cyber-Security Attacks on Microgrid and Its Mitigation via Adaptive Fuzzy PID Controller,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40815-024-01841-w,16 September 2024,"Rajendra Kumar Khadanga, Sidhartha Panda, Deepa Das","Cyberattacks on frequency stability problems pose a significant threat to microgrids. Furthermore, frequency fluctuations brought on by cyberattacks in any region of the microgrid impact the system, endangering the stability of the network. This problem can be fixed using a self-adaptive virtual inertia control strategy, which enhances the microgrid’s stability and damping capabilities. When using this control method, the evaluation of the microgrid’s frequency data is obtained through the usage of a phase-locked loop (PLL). However, because of its system dynamics, PLL implementation in microgrids produces more frequency oscillation. Once more, this work addresses the above problem by presenting a robust adaptive fuzzy PID controller (AFPID) for virtual inertia control. This controller will simultaneously increase the stability of the microgrid system and reduce the undesired frequency measurement impacts caused by cyberattacks. A unique modified artificial ecosystem-based optimization technique (mAEO) is put forth to fine-tune the controller parameters further. The effectiveness of the suggested solutions is examined by contrasting the simulation results with a few common strategies while considering changes in system parameters and varying rates of cyberattacks.",cyberattacks frequency stability problem pose significant threat microgrids furthermore frequency fluctuation brought cyberattacks region microgrid impact system endanger stability network problem fix use selfadaptive virtual inertia control strategy enhances microgrids stability damp capability use control method evaluation microgrids frequency data obtain usage phaselocked loop pll however system dynamic pll implementation microgrids produce frequency oscillation work address problem present robust adaptive fuzzy pid controller afpid virtual inertia control controller simultaneously increase stability microgrid system reduce undesired frequency measurement impact cause cyberattacks unique modify artificial ecosystembased optimization technique maeo put forth finetune controller parameter effectiveness suggest solution examine contrast simulation result common strategy consider change system parameter vary rate cyberattacks

The reality is that, for many, security measures are often exasperatingly inaccessible.

Furrer,"Cyber-physical systems are at the core of our current civilization. Countless examples dominate our daily life and work, such as driverless cars that will soon master our roads, implanted medical devices that will improve many lives, and industrial control systems that control production and infrastructure. Because cyber-physical systems manipulate the real world, they constitute a danger for many applications. Therefore, theirsafetyandsecurityare essential properties of these indispensable systems. The long history of systems engineering has demonstrated that the system quality properties—such as safety and security—strongly depend on the underlyingsystem architecture. Satisfactory system quality properties can only be ensured if the fundamental system architecture is sound! The development of dependable cyber-physical architectures in recent years suggests thattwoharmonical architectures are required: adesign-time architectureand arun-time architecture. The design-time architecture defines and specifies all parts and relationships, assuring the required system quality properties. However, in today’s complex systems, ensuring all quality properties in all operating conditions during design time will never be possible. Therefore, an additional line of defense against safety accidents and security incidents is indispensable: This must be provided by the run-time architecture. The run-time architecture primarily consists of aprotective shellthat monitors the run-time system during operation. It detects anomalies in system behavior, interface functioning, or data—often using artificial intelligence algorithms—and takes autonomous mitigation measures, thus attempting to prevent imminent safety accidents or security incidents before they occur.

These threats can pose any potential risk within the system context and disrupt the critical healthcare service delivery. It is therefore necessary for the healthcare organisations to understand and tackle the threats to ensure overall security and resilience. However, threats are continuously evolved and there is large amount of unstructured security-related textual information is available. This makes the threat assessment and management task very challenging. There are a number of existing works that consider Machine Learning models for detection and prediction of cyber attack but they lack of focus on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the threat information from unstructured security-related text. To this end, this work proposes a novel method to assess and manage threats by adopting natural language processing. The proposed method has been tailored for the healthcare ecosystem and allows to identify and assess the possible threats within healthcare information infrastructure so that appropriate control and mitigation actions can be taken into consideration to tackle the threat. In detail, NLP techniques are used to extract the useful threat information related to specific assets of the healthcare ecosystems from the largely available security-related information on Internet (e.g. cyber security news), to evaluate the level of the identified threats and to select the required mitigation actions.

This framework utilizes an integrated intelligent approach to enhance intrusion detection and classification capabilities for digital twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems (DT-ICPS). The proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) combines two strategies to improve security. First, we present an innovative approach to identifying essential features using explainable AI and ensemble-based filter feature selection (XAI-EFFS). By using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we analyze the impact of different variables on predictive outcomes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid GRU-LSTM deep-learning model for detecting and classifying intrusions. We optimize the hyperparameters of the GRU-LSTM model by using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates excellent performance, outperforming conventional state-of-the-art techniques with an accuracy rate of 98.96%, which is a remarkable improvement. Additionally, it effectively detects zero-day attacks, contributing to digital twin-based ICPS cybersecurity resilience.",rise digital twinbased operational improvement pose challenge protect industrial cyberphysical system crucial safeguard digital twin disclose internals create increase attack surface however leverage digital twin simulate attack physical infrastructure becomes essential enhance icps cybersecurity resilience paper introduces integrate intelligent defense framework call cyberdefender study various attack digital twinbased icps fourlayer perspective ie digital twinbased industrial cyberphysical system infrastructure layer honeynet softwaredefined industrial network layer intelligent security platform layer smart industrial application layer demonstrate feasibility implement proofofconcept poc solution use opensource tool include aws cloud infrastructure tpot honeynet mininet sdn support elk tool data management docker containerization framework utilizes integrate intelligent approach enhance intrusion detection classification capability digital twinbased industrial cyberphysical system dticps propose intrusion detection system id combine two strategy improve security first present innovative approach identify essential feature use explainable ai ensemblebased filter feature selection xaieffs use shapley additive explanation shap analyze impact different variable predictive outcome secondly propose hybrid grulstm deeplearning model detect classify intrusion optimize hyperparameters grulstm model use bayesian optimization algorithm propose method demonstrates excellent performance outperform conventional stateoftheart technique accuracy rate remarkable improvement additionally effectively detects zeroday attack contribute digital twinbased icps cybersecurity resilience
