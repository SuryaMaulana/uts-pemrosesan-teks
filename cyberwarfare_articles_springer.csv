Navigating digital divide: exploring the influence of ideological and political education on cyber security and digital literacy amid information warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-06106-1,23 May 2024,Baihang Huang,"This study investigates the intricate relationship between ideological and political education (IPE), cyber security, and digital literacy within the context of online information warfare, aiming to shed light on strategies for navigating the digital divide. Utilizing a quantitative research approach and convenience sampling, data were collected through a meticulously crafted online survey from a diverse range of participants, including students, professionals, and other individuals. Analysis of the data, conducted using SPSS software and Smart-PLS 3, revealed several significant findings. Firstly, there exists a pronounced disparity in access to diverse online information based on individuals’ levels of IPE. Additionally, media literacy skills exhibit significant variation across different levels of IPE. Furthermore, the study elucidates how IPE influences individuals’ propensity to engage in online echo chambers and their susceptibility to cyber security vulnerabilities. Finally, it underscores the role of IPE in shaping digital participation and civic engagement. Overall, this research contributes novel insights into the complex dynamics of online information warfare and highlights the pivotal role of ideological and political education in mitigating the digital divide. This study underscores the critical importance of IPE in shaping individuals’ digital literacy, cyber security awareness, and engagement with online information environments. By elucidating the impact of IPE on navigating the digital divide, this research contributes valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and stakeholders seeking to foster a more informed, resilient, and inclusive digital society."
Retaliating against cyber-attacks: a decision-taking framework for policy-makers and enforcers of international and cybersecurity law,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-024-00113-5,27 March 2024,"Sozon Leventopoulos, Kosmas Pipyros, Dimitris Gritzalis","Cyber warfare is a reality taking on increasing importance. Governments, state-sponsored actors, and non-state sponsored actors have used cyber-attacks as the “weapon of choice” due to their specific characteristics. Cyber-attacks can be highly targeted and focused, even tailored to a specific unit or system, providing limited to no physical destruction (unlike a cruise missile) and potentially resulting in no loss of life. There are several incident response frameworks and approaches that an organization can implement to enhance its security posture. Usually, these will address specific adverse events such as computer security incidents, which in turn are limited in scope and coverage, typically within an organization. Nations have made limited effort in confronting severe cyber-attacks targeting and/or threatening them, as well as in preventing these attacks from being launched. In this work, we identify and discuss a decision-taking framework that may allow state actors to adopt new options against severe cyber-attacks, not always complying with international norms. Such options are neither encouraged nor supported. On the contrary, we discuss them so that the international community is made aware of such potential frameworks. More specifically, by defining clear thresholds, roles, and responsibilities, by introducing a structured chain of command, and by identifying the potential of certain actions, policy makers can recognize an extended decision space that may lead to unpredictable deterrence options against cyber-attacks."
Cognitive warfare: an ethical analysis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-023-09717-7,04 September 2023,Seumas Miller,"This article characterises the nature of cognitive warfare and its use of disinformation and computational propaganda and its political and military purposes in war and in conflict short of war. It discusses both defensive and offensive measures to counter cognitive warfare and, in particular, measures that comply with relevant moral principles."
Modelling the dynamics of information warfare: an attacker-defender scenario using Lotka-Volterra equations,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-024-02245-7,22 October 2024,"Rashmikiran Pandey, Mrinal Pandey, Alexey Nikolaevich Nazarov","The dynamics of information warfare in an attacker-defender scenario pose significant challenges in today’s digital age. To address these challenges, this research models the dynamics of information warfare using modified Lotka-Volterra equations, adapted from predator-prey interactions, to simulate the interactions between attackers and defenders. The model captures the growth, interaction, and feedback loops of both populations, offering insights into their dynamics over time. By incorporating the attacker’s growth rate and the defender’s natural decline rate, and discretizing time for real-time simulation, the study reveals how attacker populations initially grow but decline as defenders enhance their countermeasures. The defender population stabilizes as their defensive capabilities improve, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in representing the complex dynamics of information warfare."
AI and Warfare: A Rational Choice Approach,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41302-024-00280-7,19 June 2024,Atin Basuchoudhary,"Artificial intelligence has been a hot topic in recent years, particularly as it relates to warfare and military operations. While rational choice approaches have been widely used to understand the causes of war, there is little literature on using the rational choice methodology to investigate the role of AI in warfare systematically. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring how rational choice models can inform our understanding of the power and limitations of AI in warfare. This theoretical approach suggests (a) an increase in the demand for moral judgment due to a reduction in the price of AI and (b) that without a human in the AI decision-making loop, peace is impossible; the very nature of AI rules out peace through mutually assured destruction."
A cyber warfare perspective on risks related to health IoT devices and contact tracing,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-021-06720-1,20 January 2022,"Andrea Bobbio, Lelio Campanile, Marco Gribaudo, Mauro Iacono, Fiammetta Marulli, Michele Mastroianni","The wide use of IT resources to assess and manage the recent COVID-19 pandemic allows to increase the effectiveness of the countermeasures and the pervasiveness of monitoring and prevention. Unfortunately, the literature reports that IoT devices, a widely adopted technology for these applications, are characterized by security vulnerabilities that are difficult to manage at the state level. Comparable problems exist for related technologies that leverage smartphones, such as contact tracing applications, and non-medical health monitoring devices. In analogous situations, these vulnerabilities may be exploited in the cyber domain to overload the crisis management systems with false alarms and to interfere with the interests of target countries, with consequences on their economy and their political equilibria. In this paper we analyze the potential threat to an example subsystem to show how these influences may impact it and evaluate a possible consequence."
Tactics and affordances in the mediatization of war: pro-Ukrainian cyber resistance on Telegram,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-024-00096-x,07 October 2024,"Richard Noel Canevez, Kateryna Maikovska, Lara Zwarun","When Russia escalated its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, pro-Ukrainian resisters around the world took to cyber and digital spaces to support Ukraine’s cause. Social media platform Telegram played a vital role in coordinating and mobilizing action transnationally, foregrounding the impact of platform design and use in the trajectory of war’s mediatization. Our study contributes to empirical research and theory around cyber resistance tactics and platform affordances. We use qualitative thematic analysis to examine Telegram posts from the first two months of the full-scale invasion on select pro-Ukrainian resistance channels, identifying a range of tactics constructed within Telegram. This includes a phenomenon of “kitting” whereby capable members and moderators provide tools and templates, along with guidance, to participants to lower the access barrier to cyber resistance. We discuss Telegram’s affordances in relation to these tactics and, noting how Telegram is used to coordinate action on other social media, we propose a model of user-affordances interaction in a multiplatform media environment. Lastly, we provide suggestions for designers and policymakers regarding platform designs in broadly coordinated cyber resistance."
Cyber range design framework for cyber security education and training,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00680-4,18 March 2023,"M. N. Katsantonis, A. Manikas, I. Mavridis, D. Gritzalis","The need for effective training of cyber security personnel working in critical infrastructures and in the corporate has brought attention to the evolution of Cyber Ranges (CRs) as learning and training tools. Although CRs have been organized for many years, there is a lack of standards and common methodologies that facilitate their development and optimize their effectiveness. Aiming at strengthening cyber security education and research that utilize well designed CRs, we first analyze the CRs domain to identify key characteristics, strengths and fundamental weaknesses, and based on these outcomes we propose the Cyber Range Design Framework (CRDF), which includes the CR Architecture and the CR Life-Cycle. The CR Architecture presents the main components of CRDF compliant CRs, whereas the CR Life-Cycle presents the development phases of such approaches and the activities these phases embrace. CRDF builds on the Conceptual Framework for eLearning and Training (COFELET) and on the Exercise Life-Cycle. COFELET is particularly elaborated for the development of cyber security educational approaches, by adopting its design considerations that were based on widely adopted educational theories and approaches (e.g., scenario-based, reuse of elements). CRDF envisages the elaboration of CRs which optimize their impact, mitigate their weaknesses, and minimize their preparation and running costs. Under this prism, a preliminary appreciation of the CRDF approaches effectiveness is presented along with the expected outcomes of such approaches."
‘“Son – you’ll be a soldier one day”: reconceptualising YouTube discourses on participation in memetic warfare’,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-022-00051-8,23 September 2022,Timothy Noël Peacock,"“Son – you’ll be a soldier one day”, one of thousands of comments on a YouTube video about using memes (particularly viral images) in war. Memes have grown in global importance, from their central propaganda/morale-influencing role in the War in Ukraine to political campaign conflicts around major issues to virtual ‘battles’ involving online communities. However, while citizen participation in discourses concerning conflict has been receiving increased attention, such wider participation around meme conflict remains under-explored in scholarship. The online audio-visual and textual discourse around memetic warfare is important both in understanding wider public views of conflict, and, particularly in this case, given the blurring of distinctions in which acts of speech or creating videos may themselves involve directly contributing to meme ‘warfare’. This article will aim to map emerging perceptions of this digital participation, including how views of memetic warfare are framed by particular historical analogies and tropes from popular culture. The research draws on comments of selected YouTube videos on memetic warfare. The new framework adopted may serve as a basis for future investigation of online public debates and attitudes towards memetic or other forms of technological innovation in war, such as broader definitions of cyber, drone, or space security."
Anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems using actuator state transition model,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-024-02128-x,23 August 2024,"Rajneesh Kumar Pandey, Tanmoy Kanti Das","Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are vulnerable to cyber attacks which disrupt the operations of the associated physical process. Sensors are deployed in CPS to observe its functioning and control systems like actuators, Remote Terminal Units (RTU), programmable logic controllers (PLC), etc., are used to change the state of the CPS. Any abnormal state transitions due to cyber attack or natural fault may not be detected by the traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Behavior specification-based IDS, which employs laws of physics to detect the intrusion, may be helpful in this context. However, specifying acceptable behaviors based on the laws of physics for all the installed control systems for a complex CPS like a smart grid, water treatment plant, etc., is a challenging task. Here, we employ a data-driven strategy to model the behavior of each control system installed in a CPS. Later, we use the models to predict the acceptable states of all the control systems. We utilize an AI-based classifier to model control systems such as actuators. Subsequently, we juxtapose the actual states of the actuators with their predicted states, examining how this combination correlates with the overall state of the CPS to identify anomalies. Typically, there should be a strong correlation between predicted and actual states, making the Hamming distance between them a crucial factor in our experimentation. To establish the relationship between controller states and CPS states, we employ a novel deep neural network-based approach for classification. Experimental validation of our approach leverages data from a water treatment testbed, where we achieve superior performance compared to the most state-of-the-art methods, achieving aF1-scoreof0.96."
The evolution of ransomware attacks in light of recent cyber threats. How can geopolitical conflicts influence the cyber climate?,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-023-00095-w,13 July 2023,"Fabian Teichmann, Sonia R. Boticiu, Bruno S. Sergi","This article aims to analyze the current unpredictable cyber climate. In particular, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has heightened concerns about security incidents, and ransomware attacks have become a credible threat to businesses around the world. Ransomware attackers often target large companies or companies holding sensitive data, and companies have suffered significant losses in monetary terms and business opportunities. The main research methodology used for this study is desk research. Specifically, an extensive literature review was conducted on the latest trends in ransomware and geopolitical conflict in order to provide an overview of the current cyber climate in light of recent events. We contribute to the literature by investigating recent ransomware attacks, focusing on how the ransom is paid, how the money is transferred to the criminals, how the cryptocurrencies might be recovered, and how sustainability and cybersecurity are linked. These issues have yet to be sufficiently debated amid the latest events in Ukraine and the ransomware gangs’ involvement in geopolitical conflicts. This study provides researchers with a means of assessing vulnerabilities, revealing a path for intended research."
Tracing the evolution of cyber resilience: a historical and conceptual review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00811-x,01 February 2024,"Vasiliki Tzavara, Savvas Vassiliadis","In 2000, during a time when cyber security research was focused on the risks and threats posed by digital systems, the notion of being able to withstand and recover from cyber attacks, also known as cyber resilience, emerged. Recently, this concept has gained increasing attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid acceleration of digitalization. While experts acknowledge the distinction between cyber security and cyber resilience, the exact definition and evolution of the latter remain somewhat ambiguous. The aim of this paper is to offer a thorough comprehension of how the notion of cyber resilience has developed throughout history. It delves into the concept of cyber resilience and its progression over time in response to the rising frequency and complexity of cyber threats. Cyber resilience, a new concept, has gained significant recognition as a critical component of cyber security strategy across diverse sectors, encompassing public and private domains alike. It begins with an overview of the definition and key components of cyber resilience and then traces the origin of the concept from its early development in the 2000s. The paper also explores the major milestones and events that have shaped the evolution of this capacity, including changes in technology and societal factors, up to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This study provides valuable insights into future challenges for ensuring the continued resilience of digital infrastructure by examining the historical and contextual factors that have influenced the concept."
Optimal Resource Allocation and Feasible Hexagonal Topology for Cyber-Physical Systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-023-2256-z,12 June 2023,"Yifa Liu, Long Cheng","Networked cyber-physical systems are facing serious security threats from malicious attacks. It is noted that the networked cyber-physical system should take defense measures into account at the beginning of its construction. From the conservative defensive perspective, this paper proposes a robust optimal defense resource allocation strategy to reduce the maximum possible losses of the networked cyber-physical system caused by potential attacks. Then, based on the robust optimal allocation strategy, it can be proved that the topology of the networked cyber-physical system has a great influence on the loss function. In order to further improve security, the effects of adding redundant connections are investigated. Furthermore, by taking geographical knowledge into account, a hexagonal construction scheme is proposed for providing a geographically-feasible and economically-viable solution for building networked cyber-physical systems, where the loss function has a cubic decay."
Taming the leviathans in the air: a geospatial analysis of anti-terrorism air warfare in Nigeria,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-023-10882-x,13 April 2023,Opeyemi Idowu Aluko,"Violence is a common phenomenon in human history. Several violence of different magnitude has wax and wane in different part of the world. Different methods had been applied to curb violence successively. In Nigeria, the urban violence in recent times had change dimension. It had become multi hydra headed and it had made it difficult for the security forces to curb in a short time. These leviathans include; Boko Haram terrorism, Islamic State of West Africa, Fulani Militia, Niger Delta Militia among others. The introduction of geospatial data for air bombardment in recent times in the warfare had change the dynamics of taming violence in the country. Conflict and Tyre Burning theories are used to explain the nature of violence. How had the geospatial data and air warfare assisted in mitigating terrorism in Nigeria? Data from Nigeria defence Head headquarters and Nigeria satellite Commission were analyzed. Results revealed that geospatial information analysis gives the military superior edge over the terrorist groups and it helps to engage in coordinated warfare. If the trend of geospatial data for (air) warfare is accurately sustained, the aim of taming the leviathans will be faster and easier. It will lead to rapid socioeconomic and political development in Nigeria."
A holistic and proactive approach to forecasting cyber threats,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-023-35198-1,17 May 2023,"Zaid Almahmoud, Paul D. Yoo, Omar Alhussein, Ilyas Farhat, Ernesto Damiani","Traditionally, cyber-attack detection relies on reactive, assistive techniques, where pattern-matching algorithms help human experts to scan system logs and network traffic for known virus or malware signatures. Recent research has introduced effective Machine Learning (ML) models for cyber-attack detection, promising to automate the task of detecting, tracking and blocking malware and intruders. Much less effort has been devoted to cyber-attack prediction, especially beyond the short-term time scale of hours and days. Approaches that can forecast attacks likely to happen in the longer term are desirable, as this gives defenders more time to develop and share defensive actions and tools. Today, long-term predictions of attack waves are mostly based on the subjective perceptiveness of experienced human experts, which can be impaired by the scarcity of cyber-security expertise. This paper introduces a novel ML-based approach that leverages unstructured big data and logs to forecast the trend of cyber-attacks at a large scale, years in advance. To this end, we put forward a framework that utilises a monthly dataset of major cyber incidents in 36 countries over the past 11 years, with new features extracted from three major categories of big data sources, namely the scientific research literature, news, blogs, and tweets. Our framework not only identifies future attack trends in an automated fashion, but also generates a threat cycle that drills down into five key phases that constitute the life cycle of all 42 known cyber threats."
Jordanians’ Perceptions and Attitudes Toward the Amended Cyber Crime Law in Jordan: A Visual and Multimodal Analysis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11196-024-10169-5,26 June 2024,"Aseel Zibin, Abdel Rahman Mitib Altakhaineh, Amal Abuanzeh, Ahmad Ali Kabbaha","This study examines the visual [monomodal] and multimodal metaphorical representations of Jordanians’ perceptions and attitudes toward the amended Cyber Crime Law in Jordan as depicted by Jordanian activists and image creators online. It adopts Forceville’s theory of Multimodal Metaphor [1,2] as its theoretical framework. Twenty visual and multimodal depictions were collected from online platforms and were analysed to identify metaphorical representations. The results reveal a higher frequency of use of multimodal metaphors over monomodal ones, which can potentially be attributed to the former employing both visual and verbal cues; thus, improving message clarity and comprehensibility. The analysis depicts a predominantly negative image of Jordanian perceptions and attitudes, portraying the law as asilencer, barbed wires, andhandcuffswhich demonstrates its perceived restriction of Jordanians’ freedom of speech in digital space and their online activities. Jordanians were also visually depicted aspotential criminals, suggesting that ordinary citizens are potentially viewed as suspects or criminals under the new Cyber Crime Law. The study highlights the influential role of visual representations in shaping public opinions and perceptions of laws."
AI-enabled remote warfare: sustaining the western Warfare paradigm?,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-021-00337-w,21 July 2021,Ash Rossiter,"The most prominent feature of Western approaches to warfare in recent decades has been the centrality of precision-strike systems and related capabilities—most notably unmanned platforms—for delivering lethal force with ever-greater remoteness. Comparative advantages derived from this ‘remote warfare’ are waning due to competitors’ partial adoption of precision weapon systems and the development of countermeasures. Analyses by military experts and technology enthusiasts in the West propose that Artificial Intelligence (AI), properly harnessed, will soon resuscitate former advantages derived from remote warfare, which have been subject to diminishing returns. The assumptions underpinning this conclusion, however, rest on weaker ground than is claimed. First, AI boosters—unwittingly or otherwise—frequently overstate the near-term impact of AI on important aspects of remote warfare, downplaying enduring technological challenges, and overlooking vulnerabilities associated with greater reliance on AI-enabled systems. Furthermore, it is far from clear whether over the longer-term AI will enhance and entrench the central aspects of remote warfare. Indeed, the technology may lean toward methods of warfare antithetical to the Western warfare paradigm, such as mass over precision or the widespread deployment of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS)."
To subdue the enemies without fighting: Chinese state-sponsored disinformation as digital warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-022-00052-7,23 September 2022,Isabel Fangyi Lu,"This paper examines the nuanced practices of Chinese state-sponsored disinformation campaigns as participatory digital warfare. Utilising Sun Tzu’s three conceptsqizheng(奇正), xingshi(形势) andxushi(虚实), it proposes to analyse disinformation beyond the framework of political communication. With two examples, I analyse how disinformation campaigns can implicate contemporary China’s state-building. I demonstrate that disinformation campaigns strategically utilise suggestive half-lies to mobilise alliances and silence enemies regardless of their nationalities. Depending on whether they conform to the Party agenda, some foreign actors can be enlisted as allies, while critical citizens portrayed as enemies. Overall, the paper argues that Chinese state-sponsored disinformation campaigns can stealthily recruit netizens to combat in an ongoing state-making project that potentially consolidates the authoritarian Party-state. Addressing the gap between Chinese traditional war philosophies and contemporary, technologically informed practices, this paper points out the significance of participatory and cultural countermeasures."

A personalized learning theory-based cyber-security training exercise,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00704-z,02 June 2023,"Nabin Chowdhury, Vasileios Gkioulos","Current enterprises’ needs for skilled cyber-security (CS) professionals have prompted the development of diverse CS training programs and offerings. It has been noted that even though enterprise staff is now more aware of security threats, the number of successful attacks against companies has all but decreased over the years. Several criticisms were raised against current CS training offerings, which often made them inadequate, or unable to change participants’ behavior and security attitude. One of the main factors CS training programs are often not very effective is the lack of engagement or motivation of participants. This is often the result of training not being tailored to the needs or preferences of participants. In our previous work, we tackled this issue by developing a personalized learning theory-based model for developing CS training frameworks. In this work, we utilize the model to develop two CS training exercises: two game-based scenarios using the CS training video game Cyber CIEGE and one table-top team exercise. The exercises are later tested by involving a group of 12 students from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU) Information Security master’s degree program. According to the results of the experiment and the feedback from the students, students felt more engaged during the exercises due to having been participants in their development process. This has in turn motivated them to continue using the training tools independently in their spare time. Further research is recommended to establish whether the training development model is adequate for different target groups, as well as better performing than other models when developing full-fledged training programs."
Parallel intelligence in three decades: a historical review and future perspective on ACP and cyber-physical-social systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-024-10861-9,16 August 2024,"Xingxia Wang, Jing Yang, Yuhang Liu, Yutong Wang, Fei-Yue Wang, Mengzhen Kang, Yonglin Tian, Imre Rudas, Lingxi Li, Maria Pia Fanti, Bassam Alrifaee, Muhammet Deveci, Deepak Mishra, Muhammad Khurram Khan, Long Chen, Philippe De Reffye","Recent advances in human-in-the-loop or human-centric research have sparked a new wave of scientific exploration. These studies have enhanced the understanding of complex social systems and contributed to more sustainable artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystems. However, the incorporation of human or social factors increases system complexity, making traditional approaches inadequate for managing these complex systems and necessitating a novel operational paradigm. Over decades of work, a mature and comprehensive theory of parallel intelligence (PI) has been established. Rooted in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), PI adapts flexibly to various situations within complex systems through the ACP framework (Artificial systems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution), ensuring system reliability. This paper provides a detailed review and a novel perspective on PI, beginning with the historical and philosophical origins of CPSS and proceeding to present both the fundamental framework and technological implementations of PI. PI-based Industry 5.0 is highlighted, where three pillars are adopted to help realize the supposed vision. Additionally, the paper outlines applications of PI in multiple fields, such as transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture, and discusses the opportunities and challenges for imaginative intelligence. The continuous exploration of PI is expected to eventually facilitate the realization of “6S”-based (safe, secure, sustainable, sensitive, service, and smart) parallel ecosystems."

Dhanamjayulu, Ravikumar Chinthaginjala, Baseem Khan","Cybersecurity is critical in today’s digitally linked and networked society. There is no way to overestimate the importance of cyber security as technology develops and becomes more pervasive in our daily lives. Cybersecurity is essential to people’s protection. One type of cyberattack known as “credential stuffing” involves using previously acquired usernames and passwords by attackers to access user accounts on several websites without authorization. This is feasible as a lot of people use the same passwords and usernames on several different websites. Maintaining the security of online accounts requires defence against credential-stuffing attacks. The problems of credential stuffing attacks, failure detection, and prediction can be handled by the suggested EWOA-ANN model. Here, a novel optimization approach known as Enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm (EWOA) is put on to train the neural network. The effectiveness of the suggested attack identification model has been demonstrated, and an empirical comparison will be carried out with respect to specific security analysis."
A narrative perspective of island detection methods under the lens of cyber-attack in data-driven smart grid,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43067-023-00083-4,14 March 2023,"Apoorva Shukla, Soham Dutta, Sourav Kumar Sahu, Pradip Kumar Sadhu","As criminals and hackers are developing new methods to interfere with the operation of the power grid, the nature of grid vulnerabilities and threats is continuously evolving. The growing interest in transitioning the unidirectional power system to a bidirectional data-driven modern grid will further escalate these issues. The question of cyber security becomes essential in particular critical decisions such as island detection. The incorrect decision of island occurrence may completely disrupt the operation of a portion of the grid, causing substantial damage to electrical equipment and grid maintenance workers. Fast monitoring and accurate control of unplanned islanding detection are essential for distributed generation-based active networks for providing continuous power supply to critical loads. Considering the above aspects, this paper serves on the perspective of different island detection methods and various aspects of cyber security. The type of cyber-attacks is categorized in terms of their behavior. Key points are discussed about how, when, and in what fashion and degree it can harm all the sectors of the grid, i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution system. Finally, the impact of cyber-physical attacks on the islanding decision system is presented. The research remedies for such measures are also presented. Moreover, a comparison is being made among various island detection methods based on the extent of impact of different cyber-attacks on the operation of these methods. Some promising future solutions for cyber-secure island detection methods are also suggested."
Smart soldiers: towards a more ethical warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-022-01385-3,29 January 2022,Femi Richard Omotoyinbo,"It is a truism that, due to human weaknesses, human soldiers have yet to have sufficiently ethical warfare. It is arguable that the likelihood of human soldiers to breach the Principle of Non-Combatant Immunity, for example, is higher in contrast tosmart soldierswho are emotionally inept. Hence, this paper examines the possibility that the integration of ethics into smart soldiers will help address moral challenges in modern warfare. The approach is to develop and employ smart soldiers that are enhanced with ethical capabilities. Advocates of this approach think that it is more realistic to make competent entities (i.e., smart soldiers) become morally responsible than to enforce moral responsibility on human soldiers with inherent (moral) limitations. This view somewhat seeks a radical transition from the usual anthropocentric warfare to arobocentricwarfare with the belief that the transition has moral advantages. However, the paper defends the claim that despite human limitations, the capacity ofethically enhanced smart soldiersfor moral sensitivity is artificial and unauthentic. There are significant problems with the three models of programming ethics into smart soldiers. Also, there are further challenges from the absence of emotion as a moral gauge, and the problems of apportioning responsibility in case of mishap from the actions or omissions of smart soldiers. Among other reasons, the paper takes the replacement of human soldiers as an extreme approach towards an ethical warfare. This replacement predicates ethical complications that outweigh the benefits from the exclusive use of smart soldiers."
The trans-national cybercrime court: towards a new harmonisation of cyber law regime in ASEAN,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-023-00105-x,06 December 2023,"Kwan Yuen Iu, Vanessa Man-Yi Wong","Legal harmonisation of cyber laws in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is necessary to combat the transnational nature of cybercrimes. However, this is a difficult task in ASEAN as it requires all ASEAN member states to agree on a uniform cybercrime regulatory framework. The rapid evolution of cybercrime also undermines the strength of a static convention. This leads to the following question: How can a harmonized regulatory framework that would efficiently tackle the rapid evolution of cybercrime be designed? Regrettably, the Budapest Convention failed to facilitate the legal harmonisation in ASEAN with its inability to reach universal consensus. This paper argues that a regional cybercrime court, namely the ASEAN Cybercrime Court, can be an alternative approach to achieving legal harmonisation with the prevalence of cybercrimes. The theoretical framework of this paper is based on the concept of international common law articulated by Andrew Guzman and Timothy Meyer, in which certain members unable to agree on a broad agreement can instead agree to shallow rules to create an institution with authority to promulgate rules. In effect, it reduces the transaction costs for reaching a consensus. This paper also analyses the feasibility and merit of the creation of the ASEAN Cybercrime Court from three aspects: the jurisdiction, the existence of an independent prosecutorʼs office and the legal interpretation. Although the solution is not a perfect answer to legal harmonisation, it serves as a starting point on a path to progress ultimately leading to the conclusion of a binding multilateral treaty."

OSINT is currently expanding at an incredible rate, bringing new artificial intelligence-based approaches to address issues of national security, political campaign, the cyber industry, criminal profiling, and society, as well as cyber threats and crimes. In this paper, we have described the current state of OSINT tools/techniques and the state of the art for various applications of OSINT in cyber security. In addition, we have discussed the challenges and future directions to develop autonomous models. These models can provide solutions for different social network-based security, digital forensics, and cyber crime-based problems using various machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) with OSINT."

Artificial intelligence in the long view: from mechanical intelligence to cyber-social systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44163-022-00029-1,09 August 2022,"Bill Cope, Mary Kalantzis","Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a defining technology of our time, a source of fear as often as inspiration. Immersed in its practicalities, rarely do we get to ask the question, what is it? How does it impact our lives? How does it extend our human capacities? What are its risks? What are its limits? This paper is a theoretical and historical overview of the nature of binary computing that underpins AI and its relations with human intelligence. It also considers some philosophical questions about the semiotic or sense-creating work of computers. Our argument proceeds in five steps. We begin with an historical background: since Ada Lovelace, we have wondered about the intelligence of machines capable of computation, and the ways in which machine intelligence can extend human intelligence. Second, we ask, in what ways does binary computing extend human intelligence and delimit the scope of AI? Third, we propose a grammar with which to parse the practical meanings that are enabled with and through binary computing. Through this discussion, we raise the question of ontology as a counter-balance to what we will argue has been an over-emphasis on the instrumental reasoning processes of the algorithm. Fourth, we situate binary computing in the context of broad developments in modern societies which we characterize as a series of systems transitions: from industrial, to informational, to a new phase that we term “cyber-social.” Finally, we explore the risks inherent in a pervasively cyber-social system. These are narrowly captured in the technical domain, “cybersecurity.” We set out to reconceive this problem framework as the location for a potential solution, supplementing analyses of cybersecurity risk with a program of cyber-social trust."

Al-Ghuraybi, Mohammed A. AlZain, Ben Soh","In this rapidly advancing era, technology has been progressing extensively and swiftly. As a result, the emergence of numerous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has become imperative to meet the technological demands of modern life. However, these systems generate a substantial amount of data, which poses challenges in terms of management, storage, and susceptibility to external attacks. This paper primarily focuses on the performance and security aspects of CPS, particularly in countering external threats, through the integration of blockchain technology and machine learning. It provides a comprehensive review of recent research findings that demonstrate the use of blockchain to enhance CPS performance while ensuring robust security. Furthermore, the paper explores the synergistic application of blockchain and machine learning techniques to reinforce CPS security. Moreover, it investigates how the combination of blockchain with physically unclonable functions (PUF) can significantly enhance the efficacy of physical device authentication."
Cyber governance studies in ensuring cybersecurity: an overview of cybersecurity governance,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-021-00045-4,11 January 2022,"Serkan Savaş, Süleyman Karataş","With the exponential increase of digital data in cyber environments, security measures have gained more importance. Cybersecurity threats are revealed by national and international units, and the number of these threats is increasing daily. The elimination of cybersecurity risks is possible with an effective cybersecurity strategy. Since the concept of management is not sufficient, the implementation of this strategy is possible with cyber governance, which includes all stakeholders in the management processes. This study emphasizes the importance and necessity of cyber governance in ensuring cybersecurity. The research and results for cybersecurity governance have been examined. A descriptive research model was used to this end. In terms of research philosophy, a basic research model and a documentary research model have been created with regard to the application method. The universe of the research consists of studies obtained from Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, Google Scholar, and TR Index. Studies from the last 5 years have been downloaded with the determined keywords. The result showed that although there are studies that produce local solutions for cybersecurity governance in different countries, a general governance framework has not been established as yet. On the contrary, there is a latent struggle to retain the management of this area, not its governance."
Aviation cyber security: legal aspects of cyber threats,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12198-021-00232-8,12 April 2021,Michal Klenka,"The aim of this paper is show how existing legal frameworks applied to civil aviation might be relevant in the context of cyberspace. Security threats to civil aviation operations have become more sophisticated and challenging to deal with. One that is emerging, and arguably even more complicated and sophisticated to manage, is the cyber-attack. This article is interdisciplinary as it briefly defines cyber-attack and describes the nature of the threat it poses to aviation and society generally, but also focuses on the international legal instruments that are available to address cyberterrorism and reflects on the challenges faced by aviation through cyberspace. Conclusions offer some food for thought on the article’s conclusions and on possible developments in the relationship between civil aviation and cyber security."
An Explorative Study into the Importance of Defining and Classifying Cyber Terrorism in the United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00962-5,24 November 2021,Victoria Jangada Correia,"Terrorism, crime, and war are all familiar notions; however, the way in which these have been altered through cyberspace is not yet fully, nor unanimously, understood through definitions, theories, and approaches. Although the threat level of terrorism in the UK has lowered to moderate, the threat posed by cyber terrorism has nonetheless heightened throughout the COVID pandemic due to the greater necessity and presence of technology in our lives. This research aimed to highlight the necessity for a unanimous cyber terrorism definition and framework and further aimed to determine what perceptions are held by the general public regarding cyber terrorism through a mixed methods approach. The literature review confirms that there is an absence of a unanimously agreed upon definition of cyber terrorism, and furthermore that the existing academic definitions are not compatible with UK legislation. In addition, the literature review highlights an absence of a cyber terrorism framework that classifies what kind of terrorist activity is cyber enabled or cyber dependent. Quantitative data from the online survey find a couple of significant effects implying the necessity for greater diversity amongst stakeholders which could potentially enhance the detection and prevention of terrorism in the UK. The qualitative data find that although there is some agreement amongst the sample population in views held towards cyber terrorism, some misconceptions are nonetheless present which could have implications on the general public’s ability to identify and report cyber terrorist activity. Overall, the findings from the literature review and the primary data collection aid in developing a cyber terrorism definition that is compatible with UK legislative definitions, and further aids in developing a terrorist activity framework that succinctly highlights the inextricable links between traditional, cyber enabled, and cyber-dependent terrorism."

Light footprint—heavy destabilising impact in Niger: why the Western understanding of remote warfare needs to be reconsidered,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-021-00362-9,11 January 2022,"James Rogers, Delina Goxho","Remote warfare has become a ‘catch-all’ term, used to describe the so-called ‘light footprint’, ‘low-risk’, and ‘distant’ characteristics of contemporary Western warfighting. Typified by a reliance on military airpower, new weapon technologies, special operations forces, and the support of local partners, proxies, and surrogates, this form of modern warfare has allowed the USA and its Western coalition member to meet national security threats globally, yet withoutr having to endure the heavy cost to their soldier’s lives that defined Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). Nevertheless, in this article, we argue that this perception of remote warfare needs reappraising. By analysing the case of Niger, we highlight how the means and mechanisms of remote warfare have now proliferated to a plethora of state actors, with varying ambitions, who combine their ‘light footprint’ tosaturatedistant zones of conflict and sovereign nations considered to be ‘strategic choke-points’. Although adopted as the blueprint for militarily effective and politically attuned global force deployment by a range of nations, we question the extent to which it is still politically useful, militarily effective, or indeed academically accurate to consider remote warfare as ‘light footprint’ at all."

Informed by cultural theorist Paul Virilio’s commentaries on speed, light-speed, and war, this article examines speed as an inflection that insidiously underpins the Australian Government’s 2023National Defence: Defence Strategy Review(DSR) (public version). This is not an exhaustive study of light-speed or the DSR. Rather, this article aims to show how speed and light-speed, used as investigatory lenses, can provide critical insights into relationships between contemporary technology, and war.

Analyzing digital propaganda and conflict rhetoric: a study on Russia’s bot-driven campaigns and counter-narratives during the Ukraine crisis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-024-01322-w,23 August 2024,"Rebecca Marigliano, Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Kathleen M. Carley","The dissemination of disinformation has become a formidable weapon, with nation-states exploiting social media platforms to engineer narratives favorable to their geopolitical interests. This study delved into Russia’s orchestrated disinformation campaign, in three times periods of the 2022 Russian-Ukraine War: its incursion, its midpoint and the Ukrainian Kherson counteroffensive. This period is marked by a sophisticated blend of bot-driven strategies to mold online discourse. Utilizing a dataset derived from Twitter, the research examines how Russia leveraged automated agents to advance its political narrative, shedding light on the global implications of such digital warfare and the swift emergence of counter-narratives to thwart the disinformation campaign. This paper introduces a methodological framework that adopts a multiple-analysis model approach, initially harnessing unsupervised learning techniques, with TweetBERT for topic modeling, to dissect disinformation dissemination within the dataset. Utilizing Moral Foundation Theory and the BEND Framework, this paper dissects social-cyber interactions in maneuver warfare, thereby understanding the evolution of bot tactics employed by Russia and its counterparts within the Russian-Ukraine crisis. The findings highlight the instrumental role of bots in amplifying political narratives and manipulating public opinion, with distinct strategies in narrative and community maneuvers identified through the BEND framework. Moral Foundation Theory reveals how moral justifications were embedded in these narratives, showcasing the complexity of digital propaganda and its impact on public perception and geopolitical dynamics. The study shows how pro-Russian bots were used to foster a narrative of protection and necessity, thereby seeking to legitimize Russia’s actions in Ukraine whilst degrading both NATO and Ukraine’s actions. Simultaneously, the study explores the resilient counter-narratives of pro-Ukraine forces, revealing their strategic use of social media platforms to counteract Russian disinformation, foster global solidarity, and uphold democratic narratives. These efforts highlight the emerging role of social media as a digital battleground for narrative supremacy, where both sides leverage information warfare tactics to sway public opinion."
Anomaly and cyber fraud detection in pipelines and supply chains for liquid fuels,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-022-09843-5,23 January 2022,"Alinne Beteto, Vidal Melo, Jessica Lin, Marwan Alsultan, Eduardo Mario Dias, Elizabeth Korte, DeAndre A. Johnson, Negin Moghadasi, Thomas L. Polmateer, James H. Lambert","A recent large-scale information disruption of the Colonial Pipeline across the USA has highlighted the cyber vulnerabilities of the supply chains of liquid fuels. Information disruption and associated anomalies have become routine events for critical infrastructure of sociotechnical systems. The logistics systems that support energy commodity supply chains are vulnerable to information threats that evolve throughout the system life cycles. Among the prevalent threats energy supply chains are malicious hacking, fraud, information theft, ransomware, and related irregular activities. Fraud and malicious activity are not new in the supply chains for liquid fuels, though mechanisms and consequences may be changing. This paper addresses information anomalies that are on a spectrum of errors, lost data, fraud, cyber, ransomware and related disruptions to logistics systems that support e-commerce and distribution of liquid fuels, particularly for challenges associated with human and organizational errors whose frequencies may be increasing in the latest pandemic. The lessons learned can help to improve the anomalies monitoring systems thus protecting the interests of consumers, industry, and the government. A case featuring fuels distribution, cyber-physical-systems and the internet of things (IoT) is presented to illustrate several issues that are challenging the design and operation of government-mandated inspection and detection processes for fraud and anomalies. In particular, an Authenticator and Transmitter System (SAT) concept is described for remote monitoring of fuel distribution points via a secure communication channel between the fuel pumps and government regulators. The data collected in this approach are used to analyze the behavior of fuel distribution points and detect anomalous behaviors that could indicate fraud and/or fraud-like precursors to other information disruptions. The method technologies that are described in this paper helps to detect precursors of fraud and other information irregularities in their earliest stages, and to enhance policies that protect the information systems of fuel pipelines and their related logistics systems. Methods such as described herein are integrated among layers of complex information technologies to protect the interests of the energy sector, consumers, and government."

The hidden hierarchy of far-right digital guerrilla warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-021-00032-3,09 June 2021,"Letícia Cesarino, Pedro H. J. Nardelli","The polarizing tendency of politically leaned social media is usually claimed to be spontaneous, or a by-product of underlying platform algorithms. This contribution revisits both claims by articulating the digital world of social media and rules derived from capitalist accumulation in the post-Fordist age, from a transdisciplinary perspective articulating the human and exact sciences. Behind claims of individual freedom, there is a rigid pyramidal hierarchy of power heavily using military techniques developed in the late years of the cold war, namely Russia Reflexive Control and the Boyd’s decision cycle in the USA. This hierarchy is not the old-style “command-and-control” from Fordist times, but an “emergent” one, whereby individual agents respond to informational stimuli, coordinated to move as a swarm. Such a post-Fordist organizational structure resembles guerrilla warfare. In this new world, it is the far right who plays the revolutionaries by deploying avant-garde guerrilla methods, while the so-called left paradoxically appears as conservatives defending the existing structure of exploitation. Although the tactical goal is unclear, the strategic objective of far-right guerrillas is to hold on to power and benefit particular groups to accumulate more capital. We draw examples from the Brazilian far right to support our claims."
Evolutionary Functions of Cyber and Traditional Forms of Aggression in Adolescence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-021-00297-7,16 September 2021,"Kiana R. Lapierre, Andrew V. Dane","This study examined how cyber and traditional aggression and victimization were differentially related to adolescent reports of using aggression to pursue evolutionarily relevant functions. To consider variations in the power balance between perpetrators and victims, the study examined bullying, in which the power of the perpetrator exceeded that of the victim, and adversarial aggression, in which the perpetrator had equal or less power than the victim. Participants included 379 adolescents, ages 11–14 (M= 12.86; SD = .84). As expected, cyberbullying and traditional bullying were consistently associated with proactive functions, including dominance, aggression deterrence and intrasexual competition (competitive), seeking status and mates (impression management), and enjoyment (sadistic), in line with the goal-directed nature of bullying. In contrast, cyber and traditional forms of adversarial aggression and victimization were associated with competitive and reactive functions (for boys only in cyber form), consistent with expectations that adversarial aggression would occur in the context of intrasexual competition. Relations with functions differed by gender only for cyber aggression. Cyberbullying was more strongly linked to competitive functions for girls, whereas adversarial cyber aggression related to competitive functions only for boys, and linked more strongly with reactive functions for girls, suggesting that girls may be more risk averse in their use of cyber aggression. In addition, traditional bullying was associated with both proactive and reactive motives, whereas cyberbullying was related only to proactive functions. The implications of differentiating the evolutionarily relevant aggressive functions associated with adolescents’ experiences of bullying and adversarial aggression are discussed."
The Shift of China’s Strategic Thinking on Cyberwarfare Since the 1990s,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-022-09813-3,23 June 2022,Tianjiao Jiang,"It has been widely argued that China has prepared for launching cyberwarfare against the United States for long time. There are two reasons for this. First, the revolution of cyber technology changed the offense-defense balance, which will lead to frequent cyber conflicts. Second, with the relative decline of the United States and the rising up of China in recent years, there has been growing concerns about a Thucydides Trap between the two great powers, and cyberwar is very likely to happen. However, except for disputes on cyber espionage, China showed restraint on the offensive use of its cyberpower. This paper argues that China’s strategic thinking on cyber offense, defense, and cyberwarfare has been evolving over the past decades. Through content analysis of official documents and academic writings, this paper sheds light on the recent discussions and development of China’s cyber offense and defense strategy. With China’s gradual access to the global Internet and extensive participation in the international economic division of labor, maintaining the stability of global cyberspace is of greater significance to China, and the cost of launching cyber warfare is higher and higher. Such findings help avoid miscalculation and maintain strategic stability between China and the United States in cyberspace."

Expecting an intelligence revolution in military affairs, both militaries look forward to increasing effectiveness and efficiency in intelligence, command and control, logistics, and weapon systems. Yet beneath the high promises of new technology, the strengths and weaknesses of such advances create substantial obstacles to achieving military stability between the two nations. This paper discusses the oft-neglected, multi-layered turbulence created at the intersection of technology and strategy that lies behind the current military transformation. Looking into the future, China and the U.S. need to voice concerns about the transformation’s impact on current and future conflict dynamics and take the necessary steps to enhance operational and strategic stability in an increasingly AI-integrated military arena."

The world is interconnected as never before, bringing close people, businesses, or other organizations. However, hackers are also coming close. New business and operational models require the collection and processing of massive amounts of data in real-time, involving utilization of complex information systems, large supply-chains, personal devices, etc. These impose several advantages for adversaries on the one hand (e.g., poorly protected or monitored elements, slow fashion of security updates/upgrades in components that gain little attention, etc.), and many difficulties for defenders on the other hand (e.g., administrate large and complex systems with high dynamicity) in this cyber-security interplay. Impactful attacks on ICT systems, critical infrastructures, and supply networks, as well as cyber-warfare are deriving the necessity for more effective defensives. This paper presents a swarm-intelligence solution for incident handling and response. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is continuously integrated in the system (i.e., MISP, CVEs, STIX, etc.), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) are incorporated in the risk assessment and event evaluation processes. Several incident handling and response sub-procedures are automated, improving effectiveness and decreasing response time. Information concerning identified malicious activity is circulated back to the community (i.e., via the MISP information sharing platform) in an open loop. The proposal is applied in the supply-chain of healthcare organizations in Europe (considering also EU data protection regulations). Nevertheless, it is a generic solution that can be applied in any domain."

Cyber risk regulations for the IoT, however, are still in their infancy. This is concerning, because companies integrating IoT devices and services need to perform a self-assessment of its IoT cyber security posture. At present, there are no self-assessment methods for quantifying IoT cyber risk posture. It is considered that IoT represent a complex system with too many uncontrollable risk states for quantitative risk assessment. To enable quantitative risk assessment of uncontrollable risk states in complex and coupled IoT systems, a new epistemological equation is designed and tested though comparative and empirical analysis. The comparative analysis is conducted on national digital strategies, followed by an empirical analysis of cyber risk assessment approaches. The results from the analysis present the current and a target state for IoT systems, followed by a transformation roadmap, describing how IoT systems can achieve the target state with a new epistemological analysis model. The new epistemological analysis approach enables the assessment of uncontrollable risk states in complex IoT systems—which begin to resemble artificial intelligence—and can be used for a quantitative self-assessment of IoT cyber risk posture."
Logical concept mapping and social media analytics relating to cyber criminal activities for ontology creation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-022-00934-9,02 May 2022,Romil Rawat,"The backbone of the semantic web is ontology, dealing with the context of details associated with a specific domain. Domain ontology (DO) is an important source of information for knowledge-based systems. Nonetheless, developing DO is a time-consuming procedure that is heavily reliant on the developer's expertise. Here, a novel semi-automated technique for creating Ontologies in the terrorism domain is suggested. Terrorism actions provide critical information that can be used to improve a country's security system. To obtain the most up-to-date knowledge of the domain, online social network (OSN) data, specifically Twitter text data, is retrieved, and then concepts and associated relationships are recognized and mapped through formal concept analysis (FCA). The fluent editor tool (FET) displays a number of user-defined associations. Knowledge is also extracted using a query-based approach and a reasoner window in the FET. The created DO is broadcast on the web using an ontology web language (OWL) that may be used in a variety of other applications. The suggested work is notable because it creates broad-coverage DO for the terrorist domain using a tool called Fluent Editor (FE) instead of the typical tool (protégé), and semantic information is retrieved with 100% correctness, similar to a query-based search system (QBS)."

Hunter, Samantha Mullaney, Meagan Mays","Recently, there have been groundbreaking studies that seek to create unique cybersecurity datasets used to empirically test theories related to strategic cybersecurity. To date, however, this research has neglected cyber-enabled information operations (CEIO). With the remarkable amount of information operations being reported on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, there is a substantial gap in the literature regarding empirical studies on CEIO using cross-national datasets. This exploratory, descriptive study seeks to remedy this dilemma. To do so, this paper investigates the question, “What are the political and economic characteristics of states that are most likely to be targeted by CEIO over social media on Facebook?” To investigate, this exploratory, descriptive study utilizes a unique Information Operations Threat Report Dataset (2020) based on Facebook’s release of 2020 influence operations information that captures CEIO on its platform from 2017 to 2020. A descriptive data analysis reveals that mixed regimes (i.e., states that are partially authoritarian and democratic) and slightly wealthier states are more likely to be targeted in CEIO on Facebook. These exploratory findings provide useful insights into what types of states may be more susceptible to CEIO attacks on Facebook."

Particular military applications of quantum technology are described for various warfare domains (e.g. land, air, space, electronic, cyber and underwater warfare and ISTAR—intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance), and related issues and challenges are articulated."
"Advanced Persistent Threats (APT): evolution, anatomy, attribution and countermeasures",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-023-04603-y,06 May 2023,"Amit Sharma, Brij B. Gupta, Awadhesh Kumar Singh, V. K. Saraswat","In today’s cyber warfare realm, every stakeholder in cyberspace is becoming more potent by developing advanced cyber weapons. They have equipped with the most advanced malware and maintain a hidden attribution. The precocious cyber weapons, targeted and motivated with some specific intention are called as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Developing defense mechanisms and performing attribution analysis of such advanced attacks are extremely difficult due to the intricate design of attack vector and sophisticated malware employed with high stealth and evasive techniques. These attacks also include advanced zero-day and negative-day exploits and payloads. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the evolution of advanced malware design paradigms, APT attack vector and its anatomy, APT attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) and specific case studies on open-ended APT attacks. The survey covers a detailed discussion on APT attack phases and comparative study on threat life-cycle specification by various organizations. This work also addresses the APT attack attribution and countermeasures against these attacks from classical signature and heuristic based detection to modern machine learning and genetics based detection mechanisms along with sophisticated zero-day and negative day malware countermeasure by various techniques like monitoring of network traffic and DNS logs, moving target based defense, and attack graph based defenses. Furthermore, the survey addresses various research scopes in the domain of APT cyber-attacks."

I consider how the proposed new human right to live without physical or psychological threat (Grief, 2022) from above is a crucial step in developing a larger ecology of resistance that must be transnational, transspecies and transgenerational."
Unpacking the political-criminal nexus in state-cybercrimes: a macro-level typology,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-023-09486-1,07 February 2023,Anita Lavorgna,"Criminological literature on crime and deviance in cyberspace has boomed in recent years with most studies focusing on computer integrity crimes, computer content crimes and financial cybercrimes, also discussing the opportunity to consider some of these crimes as profit-driven forms of organised crime. The existing literature, however, has not addressed extensively yet the impact of the emergence and proliferation of cyber affordances on forms of state-organized crime – a conceptualization that since the late ‘80 s proved successful in shedding light, among other things, on the relationships among social structures and criminality. Seeking to address this gap, this conceptual contribution focuses on state-cybercrimes, where illegal, harmful or unjust cyber activities are committed for the benefit of a state or its agencies, offering a macro-typology to shed light on how cyber affordances are influencing and transforming the state-crime relations."
Optimal attack strategy selection of an autonomous cyber-physical micro-grid based on attack-defense game model,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-020-02678-5,19 November 2020,"Xiao-Peng Ji, Wen Tian, Weiwei Liu, Guangjie Liu","The security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has become an active research area in recent years. Autonomous micro-grid, an important component of smart grid and essentially a cyber-physical system, extends the attack surface and undermines system security. This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to describe the plausible attack-defense dynamics for autonomous micro-grid. The game is a kind of two-player, one shot, non-cooperative, and Zero-sum game, where the goal of attackers in this game is to gain the maximum payoff under a certain cost. The behavior of attackers includes two steps, intrusion and disruption, whereas the defenders can improve their defense performance by updation or reinforcement of cyber component. The optimal strategy of attackers is deduced based on the dynamic model. Finally, the case studies validate the proposed method and demonstrate its feasibility."

Often described as ’low and slow’, APTs remain undetected until the consequences of the cyber-attack become evident, usually in the form of damage to the physical world, as seen with the Stuxnet attack, or manipulation of an industrial process, as was the case in the Ukraine Power Grid attacks. Given the increasing sophistication and targeted nature of cyber-attacks, especially APTs, this paper delves into the substantial threats APTs pose to critical infrastructures, focusing on power grid substations. Through a detailed case study, we present and explore a 2-stage APT attack on an IEC 61850 power grid substation, employing a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testbed to simulate real-world conditions. More specifically, this paper discusses two significant experiments conducted to assess vulnerabilities in the control protocols used in IEC 61850 substations: IEC 60870-5-104 and IEC 61850. The integration of findings from these experiments revealed a number of previously undiscussed potential threats to power grid infrastructure that could arise from attacking one or more substations. To better address these potential threats, the paper proposes an extension to the Industrial Control System (ICS) kill chain that explicitly accounts for the consequences of attacks on the physical aspects of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)."
"Fear and empathy in international relations: Diplomacy, cyber engagement and Australian foreign policy",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41254-021-00211-9,21 April 2021,Luigi Di Martino,"Emotions in international relations, as in human relations, are invisible but leave traces in the policy articulation. Such traces can reveal how emotional interpretations of the environment in which national states operate shape and frame certain policy and strategic choices. Drawing on the concept of the “institutionalisation of empathy and fear” developed by Crawford (Int Theory 6(3):535–557, 2014), I first operationalise and then apply this concept to the Australian foreign policy. This framework is applied to the analysis of the foreign policy documents and strategies published by the Australian government in the last decade. In particular, I focus on Australia’s foreign policy articulation and interpretation of the internet and digital technologies. New, pressing problems are emerging in the digital environment due to a range of cybersecurity threats, including an increase in the frequency of automated accounts and the dissemination of fake news and digital propaganda. From perceiving the internet as a communication platform that allows for listeningtoand dialoguewithforeign publics, Australian foreign policy is increasingly framing the internet as strategic infrastructure that requires defending and guarding. The attention is, thus, moving towards short-term ‘defensive’ goals—as a result of a higher perceived fear of the latest evolution in the geopolitical context. The shift in Australian foreign policy indicates a form of institutionalisation of fear in response to the challenges emerging from the digital environment. I conclude by arguing that a more belligerent international environment highlights the tension between national interest—which evolves and changes due to political shifts and contextual elements—and the understanding of public diplomacy engagement as mutual understanding and mutual influence."
"Behind the Huawei sanction: national security, ideological prejudices or something else?",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-024-00112-6,04 March 2024,Qingxiu Bu,"Digital supremacy is fundamental to national security and global economic competitiveness. An imperative of protecting critical information infrastructure (CII) is the theoretical basis for cybersecurity policies. The cyber competition has the potential to reshape global tech supply chains and international economic governance. The winner will make standards and rules that can take the most advantage of a first mover. The assumption that governments across jurisdictions embrace similar policies, regardless of their ideologies, is not a paradoxical proposition any more in the time of globalisation 2.0. Both the US and China use law enforcement power to advance their national strategic interests. The imposition of sanctions against Huawei is an epitome of the current US–China cyber competition game far beyond the mere economic scenario. This study seeks to explore whether the unilateral approaches would be well justified in a new normal of the decoupling era and how to establish a viable global cyber governance regime."

Robots are devoted to serve, facilitate, and enhance the human life. However, many incidents have been occurring, leading to serious injuries and devastating impacts such as the unnecessary loss of human lives. Unintended accidents will always take place, but the ones caused by malicious attacks represent a very challenging issue. This includes maliciously hijacking and controlling robots and causing serious economic and financial losses. This paper reviews the main security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and their impacts, and the main security attacks within the robotics domain. In this context, different approaches and recommendations are presented in order to enhance and improve the security level of robotic systems such as multi-factor device/user authentication schemes, in addition to multi-factor cryptographic algorithms. We also review the recently presented security solutions for robotic systems."

Digital twins enable systems’ analysis, design, optimisation, and evolution to be performed digitally or in conjunction with a cyber-physical approach to improve speed, accuracy, and efficiency over traditional engineering methods. Industry 4.0, factories of the future, and digital twins continue to benefit from the technology and provide enhanced efficiency within existing systems. Due to the lack of information and security standards associated with the transition to cyber digitisation, cybercriminals have been able to take advantage of the situation. Access to a digital twin of a product or service is equivalent to threatening the entire collection. There is a robust interaction between digital twins and artificial intelligence tools, which leads to strong interaction between these technologies, so it can be used to improve the cybersecurity of these digital platforms based on their integration with these technologies. This study aims to investigate the role of artificial intelligence in providing cybersecurity for digital twin versions of various industries, as well as the risks associated with these versions. In addition, this research serves as a road map for researchers and others interested in cybersecurity and digital security."

The cyber domain is particularly dynamic: new concepts are constantly developed and need new terminological designations, which in turn need new counterparts in other languages. Formation of these designations and their counterparts often raises terminological issues that are important to deal with in order to develop a coherent system of the cyber domain terms. The given paper focuses on the terminology that includes the lexical itemcyberwhich may be considered as the main signifier of the cyber domain indicating its specific nature. The aim of the paper is threefold: to analyse the origin and development of the lexical itemcyber, to investigate conceptual categories of the EU legislation terminology that includes the lexical itemcyberand to establish the Lithuanian counterparts that are used for translation of the lexical itemcyberin the Lithuanian equivalents of the English terms. For the purposes of the study, the ad hoc English and Lithuanian corpora of the EU legislative documents were compiled. Corpus-driven methodology was used to extract and investigate the terminology used in the corpora. The results of the research are believed to provide useful information to learners and teachers of the legal language and legal translation, as well as drafters of legislative and administrative documents and other professionals engaged in cybersecurity matters."

In Society 5.0, decentralized autonomous cities and a convergence of physical and cyberspace are the foundations of the new chapter of society’s development. The idea of creating digital replicas and legitimate representatives of human beings in cyberspace has become a pillar of digitalization. Society 5.0 introduces Human Digital Twins as a central element of Cyber Physical Systems that include human factors or are designed to interact with humans in a personalized fashion. Overall, the HDT and neighboring concepts are applied to depict how humans can be represented in a cyberspace. However, there are clear challenges in determining which human characteristics should take precedence, how much autonomy should be granted to HDTs to optimize their functionality and how to conceptualize the digital environment in which HDTs interact with various entities, including other digital agents and stakeholders with agency and decisional power. To harness similarities and differences of current approaches, we propose a classification of HDTs based on meta-characteristics and ethical implications. We discuss ethical implication by focusing on emerging risks and paradigm shifts and anchor the previous discussion in the vision for Society 5.0, questioning whether societal development relying on disruptive technologies, instead of leading to more human-centered societies might be driving humanized societies away from humanity."
An overview of cybercrime law in South Africa,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-023-00089-8,02 June 2023,"Sizwe Snail ka Mtuze, Melody Musoni","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake and use of information communication technologies and led to the digital transformation of different sectors of the economy. For South Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic struck at a time when the South African government had committed itself to leveraging technology for the benefit of its citizens, the private sector, and the public sector. By 2020, South Africa already had in place enabling policy and legal frameworks to assist with the regulation of activities taking place in cyberspace. The increase in broadband access has resulted in the increase of internet users. Due to increase in use of digital technologies and processing of personal data, there has been an increase in cyber-attacks and cybercrimes such as data breaches, identity theft and cyber fraud. Several South African based companies, state owned entities, government departments and citizens have been victims of cyber-attacks. To respond to the growing spectre of cybercrime, the South African government promulgated laws to supplement the existing legal framework. It also operationalised some of the laws which had been passed but had not yet come into operation. This paper gives a summary of the evolution of cybercrime laws in South Africa. It starts off by summarising how common law and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act addressed cybercrime. The paper then proceeds to discuss the recently promulgated Cybercrimes Act, which is now the primary law criminalising certain online activities. It explores how the various provisions of the Cybercrimes Act address different types of cybercrimes known today. This discussion is aimed at demonstrating that South Africa is no longer a safe haven for cybercriminals."

Port cyberattacks from 2011 to 2023: a literature review and discussion of selected cases,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41278-023-00276-8,06 December 2023,Chalermpong Senarak,"Cyberattacks pose a significant threat to seaports worldwide. While numerous scholars have endeavored to address these threats, their findings are often limited in practicality, applying to only a few ports. This paper aims to contribute to the extant literature by presenting and discussing 15 case studies of port cyberattacks that occurred from 2011 to 2023. These cases encompass six instances in Europe, six in America, two in Asia, and one in Africa. The study employs a twofold methodology, consisting of a comprehensive literature review and a personal assessment. Several key insights emerge. First, two primary motivations drive port cyberattacks: (a) the demand for ransom payments and (b) the desire to cause severe disruptions. Second, ransomware was the most common threat used to extort payments, followed by malware and DDoS attacks, which aimed to inflict operational disruption. Third, weaknesses in cybersecurity procedures and a lack of awareness among staff members emerged as significant contributors to cyber vulnerabilities. Forth, ports that quickly detected threats and implemented response measures were able to minimize operational impacts, ensuring the swift resumption of services and the maintenance of service continuity. Fifth, collaborative efforts with external partners and officials expedited response and recovery processes by facilitating threat investigation and solution identification. In light of these findings, it becomes imperative for all ports to develop comprehensive cyber disaster management plans, covering four key phases: preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. These plans should encompass three critical aspects of cybersecurity hygiene: human factors, procedural improvements, and infrastructure enhancements. Such practices are instrumental in bolstering a port’s resilience and mitigating the risks associated with cyberattacks."

This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of AI-driven cyberattacks, offering insights into their implications, mitigation strategies, underlying motivations, and profound societal impacts. The research centres on developing and presenting the AI Cybersecurity Dimensions (AICD) Framework, a comprehensive, multidimensional schema designed to guide academics, policymakers, and industry professionals in understanding and combating the evolving challenges posed by AI-driven cyber threats. The research unveils the complex dynamics of offensive AI, stressing the need for adaptive defences and ethical considerations. Concurrently, the study highlights adversarial AI threats, calling for proactive measures to address their potential ramifications. Through rigorous textual analyses and extensive literature reviews, the paper underscores the urgency for interdisciplinary approaches to bridge the technology-humanity chasm traditionally observed in cybersecurity discussions. By synthesising these diverse elements, the AICD Framework emerges as an instrumental tool for holistic understanding and practical interventions in the AI-infused cybersecurity landscape. The paper concludes with an urgent call for collaborative efforts in research and practice to navigate the intricate challenges and capitalise on the opportunities borne from the convergence of AI and cybersecurity."
The financials of cybercrime: a health insurance pricing approach,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42786-022-00039-8,27 April 2022,"Thomas Poufinas, Nikolaos Vordonis","The expansion of information technology in everyday reality through the spread of social networks and mobile devices, emerging technologies -such as cloud services and the internet of things, has led to increased vulnerability for individuals and businesses. Individuals can suffer fraud, identity theft, embarrassment and distress when critical information (such as financial or sensitive personal data) is compromised or even publicly revealed, as a result of a cybercrime. The increase of cyber-risks impacts both individuals and entities, such as businesses and governments and renders cyber-insurance -on top of other cyber security means- more necessary with the passage of time. In this paper, it is assumed that multiple cyber-incidents are possible during the (digital) life of an individual. They resemble to illness that can affect the physical life of an individual. Illness as opposed to fatality—which has been used in research so far- can occur several times within the lifetime of an individual and the same can happen during his or her digital life, as he or she may suffer several cyber-attacks (digital illnesses) and yet digitally survive. This study mimics physical illness insurance-based actuarial pricing techniques to evaluate the cost for offering financial protection against multiple cyber-attacks, in a way similar to that of pricing health insurance. Consequently, this approach further advances the research on cyber insurance valuation and development. It can be a valuable pricing tool for the interested parties and targeted audience, as is helps estimate the residual risk left after technological cyber-security safety-nets have been used."
A History of Malaria and Conflict,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00436-024-08167-4,20 March 2024,Jonas E. Mertens,"It is supposed that in all armed conflicts until World War II more humans died of infectious diseases than of the actual violence. Especially malaria left a crucial imprint on wars throughout history. The disease aggravates wartime conditions, is thus responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in conflict zones, and is at the same time more commonly found in these areas. Malaria has halted many military campaigns in the past, with prominent examples ranging from antiquity through the medieval period and into the modern era. The parasitosis still continues to play an important role in the outcome of warfare and follow-up events today and is of special public health importance in areas of the Global South, where most of its endemicity and some of the most brutal conflicts of our time are located. Vice versa, wars and ensuing population movements increase malaria transmission and morbidity as well as impede control efforts. Awareness of this and the development of strategies to overcome both malaria and wars will massively improve the well-being of the population affected."
Security for cyber-physical systems: Secure control against known-plaintext attack,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11431-020-1621-y,06 July 2020,"Ye Yuan, YiLin Mo","There has been a surge of interests in the security of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), yet it is commonly assumed that the adversary has a full knowledge of physical system models. This paper argues that such an unrealistic assumption can be relaxed: the adversary might still be able to identify the system model by passively observing the control input and sensory data. In such a setup, the attack with knowledge of input-output data can be categorized as a Known-Plaintext Attack. A necessary and sufficient condition has been provided, under which the adversary can uniquely obtain the knowledge of the underlying physical system. From the defender’s perspective, a secure controller design—which exhibits a low rank structure—is proposed which renders the system unidentifiable to the adversary, while trading off the control system’s performance. Finally, a numerical example has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed secure controller design."
Adopting AI: how familiarity breeds both trust and contempt,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-023-01666-5,12 May 2023,"Michael C. Horowitz, Lauren Kahn, Julia Macdonald, Jacquelyn Schneider","Despite pronouncements about the inevitable diffusion of artificial intelligence and autonomous technologies, in practice, it is human behavior, not technology in a vacuum, that dictates how technology seeps into—and changes—societies. To better understand how human preferences shape technological adoption and the spread of AI-enabled autonomous technologies, we look at representative adult samples of US public opinion in 2018 and 2020 on the use of four types of autonomous technologies: vehicles, surgery, weapons, and cyber defense. By focusing on these four diverse uses of AI-enabled autonomy that span transportation, medicine, and national security, we exploit the inherent variation between these AI-enabled autonomous use cases. We find that those with familiarity and expertise with AI and similar technologies were more likely to support all of the autonomous applications we tested (except weapons) than those with a limited understanding of the technology. Individuals that had already delegated the act of driving using ride-share apps were also more positive about autonomous vehicles. However, familiarity cut both ways; individuals are also less likely to support AI-enabled technologies when applied directly to their life, especially if technology automates tasks they are already familiar with operating. Finally, we find that familiarity plays little role in support for AI-enabled military applications, for which opposition has slightly increased over time."
How to witness a drone strike,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-022-00048-3,29 September 2022,Michael Richardson,"Witnessing is crucial to public engagement with war, but the remote violence of drones presents distinct challenges: its victims are largely invisible to Western publics; operations are cloaked in secrecy; and promises of precision targeting, accurate surveillance, and legal monitoring obscure the brutalities of the system. With so many barriers to witnessing, remote warfare tends to remain on the periphery of political debate and has not occasioned widespread resistance. Yet the means for witnessing drone warfare exist; the question is how they might be leveraged to make remote war more accessible and contestable. This article analyses the high-profile drone strike that killed 10 civilians in Kabul on 29 August 2021 to consider the limits and possibilities of witnessing drone strikes, alongside the database of conflict monitor Airwars and the aesthetic practice of the research agency Forensic Architecture. It argues that witnessing drone strikes requires assembling new conceptual techniques with long-standing practices of media witnessing and human rights testimony. It is not a manual or primer but rather maps four critical, analytical, and ethico-political trajectories demanded by the problem of how to witness a drone strike: lived experiences, violent mediations, infrastructural scales, and aesthetics."
"International law is dead, long live international law: the state practice of drone strikes",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-021-00333-0,02 September 2021,Amelie Theussen,"New means and methods of war such as remote warfare by drones—the focus of this special issue—challenge international law, as there no longer exists agreement between states regarding the rules regulating the use of force. The existing legal norms are interpreted in widely diverging manners and seemingly put aside if not in the interest of the state in question. Yet, this article argues that, taking a closer look at the state practice of drone strikes beyond the paradigmatic case of the USA, the demise of international legal norms regulating the use of force seems overstated. Instead, the analysis reveals that the international laws addressing the use of force and means and methods of warfare are not as dead as the general discourse asserts, and can still serve to regulate state action."
Trends of cybercrime from 2001 to 2021: cybersecurity action plan for Papua New Guinea,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44282-023-00007-7,28 September 2023,Olugbenga Ige,"Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and by extension the Internet, have brought immense sociological transformations to humanity. Despite the development the Internet has brought to humanity, the Government of Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) has not lost sight of the fact that the use of ICTs and other related supporting devices are fraught with cybercrime and cyber insecurities that constitute challenges to global law enforcement agencies in PNG and other nations of the world. This paper reports the trends on victims of cybercrimes from 2001 to 2021 and presents an action plan for PNG. The data analysed in this study was explicated from the Internet crime reports published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and National White Collar Crime Center (IC3). The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and XGraph component of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences’ Population Pyramid. The results confirmed that the number of Internet users that were defrauded increased exponentially from 2016 to 2021. Results from the data explicated from the World Bank on Internet use, revealed that the population of Internet users in PNG and Australia will increase at a minimum rate of 1% to 2% for the next few years. These findings suggest that cybercrimes will be on the rise as the number of Internet users increase at 1% to 2% in PNG and Australia in the next few years. The findings present appropriate strategies to address the incidences of cybercrimes in PNG."
Open-source intelligence and great-power competition under mediatization,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41284-024-00446-0,12 September 2024,Jiaxi Zhou,"With the rise of mediatization, open-source intelligence (OSINT) has evolved into a decentralized form of intelligence gathering, influenced by both political and commercial logic. This transformation has positioned social media as a primary source of OSINT, enhancing the capabilities of non-state actors and significantly impacting international politics, particularly in the realm of great-power competition. Through an analysis spanning individual, state, and systemic levels, this article examines OSINT’s role in shaping contemporary international politics. By exploring case studies such as the Russo-Ukrainian War, Israel-Hamas War, and strategic competition between China and the United States, this article illuminates how OSINT influences decision-making processes and global power struggles and contributes to a deeper understanding of the evolving landscape of intelligence and its implications for statecraft."
Why converging technologies need converging international regulation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09756-8,28 February 2024,"Dirk Helbing, Marcello Ienca","Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, gene editing, nanotechnology, neurotechnology and robotics, which were originally unrelated or separated, are becoming more closely integrated. Consequently, the boundaries between the physical-biological and the cyber-digital worlds are no longer well defined. We argue that this technological convergence has fundamental implications for individuals and societies. Conventional domain-specific governance mechanisms have become ineffective. In this paper we provide an overview of the ethical, societal and policy challenges of technological convergence. Particularly, we scrutinize the adequacy of domain-specific governance mechanisms in the face of such integrated technologies and highlight their growing ineffectiveness. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive governance framework that is anticipatory, inclusive, and resilient. Central to this framework is the principle of participatory governance, which calls for a proactive engagement of all stakeholders, including those from marginalized and vulnerable populations, ensuring that their voices and concerns shape the trajectory of technological development. The framework emphasizes the need for protective measures that preemptively address potential risks and inequities that may arise from the adoption and integration of emerging technologies. Based on a detailed analysis of case studies and current governance models, we present and discuss a set of ten actionable recommendations. These are designed to facilitate the transition towards a governance approach that not only respects individual autonomy and privacy, but also fosters a collective responsibility towards sustainable and fair technological progress. By placing human dignity, societal welfare and the protection of the most vulnerable at the center of technological innovation, we advocate for a future where convergence is synonymous with progress that is both ethically grounded and universally beneficial."

Leaked email data: a new source for the study of authoritarian regimes,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-024-00097-w,05 November 2024,Sanshiro Hosaka,"This article examines the significance and practical challenges of using leaked email data for academic research into the inner mechanisms of non-democratic regimes, with a focus on Russia’s hybrid warfare against Ukraine. While investigative journalism and open-source intelligence have immensely benefited from leaked email data, academia has largely distanced itself from this novel type of reference and related empirical findings. Initial scholarly endeavors utilizing leaked emails highlight two key issues: 1) the authenticity of leaked data and the specifics of its interpretation and verification; and 2) research ethics concerning the privacy of leaked email account holders. I argue that traceability and ethical dilemmas should be addressed in tandem, considering the wider public good. The findings of this article may also apply to the study of other authoritarian regimes, such as China and Iran."
Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42400-020-00048-4,20 March 2020,"Florian Skopik, Timea Pahi","The attribution of cyber attacks is often neglected. The consensus still is that little can be done to prosecute the perpetrators – and unfortunately, this might be right in many cases. What is however only of limited interest for the private industry is in the center of interest for nation states. Investigating if an attack was carried out in the name of a nation state is a crucial task for secret services. Many methods, tools and processes exist for network- and computer forensics that allow the collection of traces and evidences. They are the basis to associate adversarial actions to threat actors. However, a serious problem which has not got the appropriate attention from research yet, are false flag campaigns, cyber attacks which apply covert tactics to deceive or misguide attribution attempts – either to hide traces or to blame others. In this paper we provide an overview of prominent attack techniques along the cyber kill chain. We investigate traces left by attack techniques and which questions in course of the attribution process are answered by investigating these traces. Eventually, we assess how easily traces can be spoofed and rate their relevancy with respect to identifying false flag campaigns."
Regulating lethal autonomous weapon systems: exploring the challenges of explainability and traceability,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00261-0,21 February 2023,"Edward Hunter Christie, Amy Ertan, Laurynas Adomaitis, Matthias Klaus","We explore existing political commitments by states regarding the development and use of lethal autonomous weapon systems. We carry out two background reviewing efforts, the first addressing ethical and legal framings and proposals from recent academic literature, the second addressing recent formal policy principles as endorsed by states, with a focus on the principles adopted by the United States Department of Defense and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We then develop two conceptual case studies. The first addresses the interrelated principles of explainability and traceability, leading to proposals for acceptable scope limitations to these principles. The second considers the topic of deception in warfare and how it may be viewed in the context of ethical principles for lethal autonomous weapon systems."
Optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty to constrain the risk of war from a militarised artificial superintelligence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-021-01382-y,11 January 2022,"Elias G. Carayannis, John Draper","This article argues that an artificial superintelligence (ASI) emerging in a world where war is still normalised constitutes a catastrophic existential risk, either because the ASI might be employed by a nation–state to war for global domination, i.e., ASI-enabled warfare, or because the ASI wars on behalf of itself to establish global domination, i.e., ASI-directed warfare. Presently, few states declare war or even war on each other, in part due to the 1945 UN Charter, which states Member States should “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force”, while allowing for UN Security Council-endorsed military measures and self-defense. As UN Member States no longer declare war on each other, instead, only ‘international armed conflicts’ occur. However, costly interstate conflicts, both hot and cold and tantamount to wars, still take place. Further, a New Cold War between AI superpowers looms. An ASI-directed/enabled future conflict could trigger total war, including nuclear conflict, and is therefore high risk. Via conforming instrumentalism, an international relations theory, we advocate risk reduction by optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT), contributing towards the ending of existing wars and prevention of future wars, as well as a Cyberweapons and Artificial Intelligence Convention. This strategy could influence state actors, including those developing ASIs, or an agential ASI, particularly if it values conforming instrumentalism and peace."
U.S. strategy of damage limitation vis-à-vis China: long-term programs and effects,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42533-024-00153-w,25 April 2024,"Bin Li, Riqiang Wu","A number of U.S. military programs, if successfully developed and deployed, could undermine China's nuclear retaliatory capabilities, thereby enhancing U.S. damage limitation capabilities vis-à-vis China. Meanwhile, China seeks to maintain the credibility of its nuclear retaliatory capabilities and increase the survivability and penetration of its nuclear weapons. These interactions are part of the nuclear competition between the United States and China. This article discusses three cases: the U.S. homeland missile defense system, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) preparations, and the space-based Ground Moving Target Indicator. These programs may serve declaratory purposes in one way or another, but their development has had a negative impact on China’s strategic nuclear retaliatory capabilities. Using non-nuclear means that differ technologically from the measures taken by China, these programs have created an asymmetric competition between the two sides. These U.S. programs have endured for several decades, and have continued to introduce new technologies despite occasional interruptions. The main element of development in these programs has been qualitative improvement, while quantitative increases have not always been evident. The development of these U.S. damage limitation capabilities put pressure on China’s nuclear retaliatory capabilities. The arms race theories developed during the Cold War are inadequate for fully understanding nuclear competition between the United States and China. We need new theories and wisdom to explore cooperative solutions."
Terrorism and the lawful preemptive use of force: the case of cyberattacks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-022-00043-8,11 May 2022,Jean-François Caron,"Twenty years of war against terror has led to humanitarian tragedies where the West has chosen to intervene in addition to being unable to durably eradicate the terrorist threat. As this text argues, this situation calls for a renewed strategy that needs to amend the legitimate use of force by reconsidering the criteria of pre-emptive actions in order to pave the way for non-violent and violent alternatives to war. In this regard, different forms of cyber actions can play a significant role in this well-needed renewed strategy."
Addressing insurance of data breach cyber risks in the catastrophe framework,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41288-020-00163-w,16 April 2020,"Spencer Wheatley, Annette Hofmann, Didier Sornette","Considering data breaches as a man-made catastrophe helps clarify the actuarial need for multiple levels of analysis—going beyond claims-driven loss statistics alone—and calls for specific advances in both data and models. The prominent human element and the dynamic, networked and multi-type nature of cyber risk are perhaps what makes it uniquely challenging. Complementary top-down statistical and bottom-up analytical approaches are discussed. Focusing on data breach severity, we exploit open data for events at organisations in the U.S. We show that this extremely heavy-tailed risk is worsening for external attacker ‘hack’ events. Writing in Q2 of 2018, the median predicted number of ids breached in the U.S. due to hacking in the last 6 months of 2018 was 0.5 billion, with a 5% chance that the figure exceeds 7 billion, doubling the historical total. ‘Fortunately’, the total breach in that period turned out to be near the median."
"Technology, institutions and regulation: towards a normative theory",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-023-01803-0,28 November 2023,"Marcus Smith, Seumas Miller","Technology regulation is one of the most important public policy issues facing society and governments at the present time, and further clarity could improve decision making in this complex and challenging area. Since the rise of the internet in the late 1990s, a number of approaches to technology regulation have been proposed, prompted by the associated changes in society, business and law that this development brought with it. However, over the past decade, the impact of technology has been profound and the associated issues for government have extremely challenging, ranging across cyber security, artificial intelligence, and many other areas. To that end, this article introduces a Theory of Institutional Technology Actors and Norms (TITAN), a normatively informed and institutionally-based account of technology regulation. It focuses on the moral and legal (including regulatory) rights and responsibilities of the relevant actors and seeks to inform the development of regulation that is both fit for purpose, rights compliant and fair for all concerned. The account incorporates the perspectives of four key categories of groups in society: producers of technology, users of technology, government regulators, and normative policy shapers."
Reactive handover coordination system with regenerative blockchain principles for swarm unmanned aerial vehicles,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-023-01572-z,26 October 2023,"S. Rajasoundaran, S. V. N. Santhosh Kumar, M. Selvi, Arputharaj Kannan","Aerial warfare systems in various countries highly expect Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Flying Adhoc Networks (FANETs) for defense stability. However, swarm UAVs face many challenges, like security breaches, malfunctions, link failures, and handover failures. UAVs can easily malfunction by external threats to create data loss, theft, signal jamming, misrouting, false handover, and location spoofing. Failures in UAV handover principles make overall gradual downtime in FANET. Against these issues, existing UAV protection mechanisms deliver location monitoring mechanisms (graphs and trees), multi-link handover mechanisms, and distributed authentication principles. However, the implantation of recent-day techniques may fail against migrating attacker events executed in electronic warfare systems. The existing security methods need improvements for protecting Multi-UAV layers effectively through end-to-end security principles. For this purpose, a new Reactive Handover Coordination System with Regenerative Blockchain (RHCRB) Principles is proposed that takes novel high-security features specially made for swarm UAVs. The proposed RHCRB implements more crucial distributed functions in each UAV on demand. The executed operations of RHCRB comprise trusted location monitoring schemes (internal and cooperative UAV movements), dynamic location-based cost magnitude calculations, regenerative blockchain principles (authentication of each UAV and active edges), confidential link management principles, secure handover coordination, and on-demand topology management principles. The technical aspects of RHCRB build lightweight and shielded handover principles against airfield vulnerabilities. The proposed model suggests implementing an entirely protected handover environment from node localization to handover events. The inspired technical aspects of RHCRB contribute to the swarm UAV environment through confidentiality using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and distributed authentication (blockchain-based node and edge management) principles to engage protected handover practices. The experimental section of this article has been tested using testbed in FlyNetSim tool for implementing RHCRB and notable recent security techniques such as the Internet of Vehicles with Decentralized Blockchains (IoV-DB), Group Handover for Internet of Defense (GH-IoD), and Handover and Optimized Security Principles for UAVs (HOOPOE). The results obtained by this system show RHCRB's 8% to 14% of betterment than existing techniques through various measures."

For the analysis, other literature published in a similar area is considered and pitched the arguments against the ones made in the book. During the year this book was released, there were numerous debates on accountability and trust in frontier digital technologies like AI. These debates have reached a systemic level where the entire global community is divided into two camps headed by the US and China in drafting rules and regulations for the internet and allied technologies. A critical comment on a well-circulated book would add clarity to the debates on the impacts of frontier digital technologies. This review contributes to the critical voices of the emerging scholarship on the confluence of digital technology and global politics.

China as a Threat and Balancing Behavior in the Realm of Emerging Technologies,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00248-0,10 April 2024,"Maria Papageorgiou, Muhammed Can, Alena Vieira","In the last years, China and the United States of America (US) have engaged in unprecedented competition in emerging technologies (ETs), in a context of China’s growing presence and shifting position in the international system. Drawing on data between 2017 and 2023 and strategic decisions, such as bans and export controls directed at China’s companies and the changing alignment posture of Western states, we employ the Balance of Threat (BoT) theory to examine China’s changing aggregate power, offensive capabilities and aggressive intentions, while also establishing the vanishing importance of the geographic dimension. We then turn to the behavior of the US and Western states by drawing on the BoT theory, which suggests balancing as a prime strategy to counter the threat and identify instances of the formation of a balancing coalition against China. We demonstrate how the notion of threat in ETs can be approached and conclude with a characterization of balancing in the domain of ETs that resonates with the notion of “gradual balancing”, in addition to outlining suggestions for future studies."
The news framing of artificial intelligence: a critical exploration of how media discourses make sense of automation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-022-01511-1,23 June 2022,"Dennis Nguyen, Erik Hekman","Analysing how news media portray A.I. reveals what interpretative frameworks around the technology circulate in public discourses. This allows for critical reflections on the making of meaning in prevalent narratives about A.I. and its impact. While research on the public perception of datafication and automation is growing, only a few studies investigate news framing practices. The present study connects to this nascent research area by charting A.I. news frames in four internationally renowned media outlets:The New York Times,The Guardian,Wired, andGizmodo. The main goals are to identify dominant emphasis frames in AI news reporting over the past decade, to explore whether certain A.I. frames are associated with specific data risks (surveillance, data bias, cyber-war/cyber-crime, and information disorder), and what journalists and experts contribute to the media discourse. An automated content analysis serves for inductive frame detection (N= 3098), identification of risk references (dictionary-based), and network analysis of news writers. The results show how A.I.’s ubiquity emerged rapidly in the mid-2010s, and that the news discourse became more critical over time. It is further argued that A.I. news reporting is an important factor in building critical data literacy among lay audiences."

There are many reasons for this; one of the most popular is the enhancement of drones’ functionalities and improvement in battery life, stabilization, navigation, sensor technology, and much more. Many benefits drive growth. However, as the number of drones is expanding and their technological functionalities are evolving, drones’ use brings many concerns and challenges that should not be underestimated. This refers to issues in the area of cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. UASs, under the international, regional, and national regime of aviation law, are considered aircraft. Since there is no existing cybersecurity framework specific to the UASs, the civil aviation cybersecurity framework should apply to their operations. This paper will focus on the potential cyber threats against UASs, providing examples of cyber-attacks from the past. Further, the aviation cybersecurity framework’s overview will follow to determine the current status of maturity at the international, regional (the European Union), and national (the Republic of Poland) levels. The paper’s conclusion will address the proposed recommendations for the UAS and aviation industries to be considered and potential solutions in terms of applying the aviation cybersecurity framework into the operation of UASs."
Explaining Wikileaks and Julian Assange as structural threats to the liberal ideological hegemony of American foreign policy,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-022-00421-9,29 October 2022,Stuart J. Hooper,"The political persecution of Julian Assange and Wikileaks by the American state is best explained by understanding the classified revelations as threats to the ideological legitimacy of its foreign policy hegemony. I apply Gramsci’s conception of hegemony, as adherence to universalized principles, to American foreign policy, which explains why ideas matter and their role in a hegemonic system. My empirical analysis primarily focuses on Wikileaks’ Collateral Murder video, and I offer three reasons to argue why Wikileaks undermines the hegemonic structure. First, the organization’s revelations, particularly of war crimes, provide evidence that directly undermines and contradicts the central liberal claims of US foreign policy ideology. Second, those leaks have bolstered the construction and legitimation of organic intellectuals within an antiwar movement that can challenge the hegemonic historic bloc. Third, the leaks question the techno-military claims of the military–industrial complex, which argues its technologies conduct smart, safe, and moral warfare."
Drones as a service (DaaS) for 5G networks and blockchain-assisted IoT-based smart city infrastructure,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-024-04354-1,17 April 2024,"Tanya Garg, Shashank Gupta, Mohammad S. Obaidat, Meghna Raj","Recent ground-breaking research in the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone technology has brought about revolutionary advancements in automation, remote sensing, and remote operations. Drones have gained massive popularity in IoT applications, like remote monitoring and task automation. Consequently, an innovative business model called Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), which aims at leasing out drones for commercial use, is gaining momentum in the market. This spike in demand for drones is credited to their ease of deployment, flexibility of operation, and risk-free functioning. To fully utilize the advantages that drones provide and further delve into the flourishing field of drone research, it is essential to acquaint ourselves with the scope of this field and understand the capabilities of a drone. The methodology employed in this survey paper encompassed a thorough literature review to establish a foundation, followed by the design and implementation of a comprehensive survey instrument. As a result, this survey provides a means for the reader to explore diverse drone research topics, ranging from basic drone types and deployment architectures to complex drone networking and communication systems.
