Perceptions and dilemmas around cyber-security in a Spanish research center after a cyber-attack,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00847-7,04 April 2024,"Joaquín Navajas-Adán, Eulàlia Badia-Gelabert, Laura Jiménez-Saurina, Mª Jesús Marijuán-Martín, Rafael Mayo-García","Information and Communication Technologies and Internet networks are present in all aspects of social reality and are essential elements in research, development and innovation centers (R&D&I). Cyber-security is crucial for the progress of the research activities developed in these centers, especially given the exponential growth of cyber-attacks and incidents. The present study aims to assess from a socio-technical approach, how a serious cyber-attack on a Spanish research center has affected staff’s perceptions of information and communication systems (ICT) security. This study employed a mixed-methods research strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of ICT security perceptions among employees. First a quantitative scale was administered to 1,321 employees 3 years before the cyber-attack and 4 months afterward, to measure ICT security perceptions. Then, qualitative techniques (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and micro-ethnography) were applied to gain a deeper understanding of the arguments underpinning cyber-security at the center after the attack. The results show that the event had an impact on employees’ perceptions, increasing the perceived importance of ICT security, with positive behavioral changes noted, but with doubts about their sustainability over time. Also, the need for cyber-security governance was critically contrasted with organizational reality. Finally, the compatibility of science and cyber-security was a central dilemma, which seems to confront antagonistic poles (research and security ICT) and justify the non-compliance with security protocols by part of the staff."
Maritime decision-makers and cyber security: deck officers’ perception of cyber risks towards IT and OT systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00810-y,02 February 2024,"Marie Haugli-Sandvik, Mass Soldal Lund, Frøy Birte Bjørneseth","Through a quantitative study of deck officers’ cyber risk perceptions towards information (IT) and operational (OT) systems, this paper contributes to substantiate the importance of considering human behaviour within maritime cyber security. Using survey data from 293 deck officers working on offshore vessels, statistical analyses were conducted to measure and predict the participants cyber risk perceptions towards IT and OT systems. Performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a significant discrepancy in the levels of cyber risk perception between the system categories. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to develop statistical models, considering multiple independent variables, including perceived benefit, cyber security training, experience with cyber-attacks, and trust towards various stakeholders. Key findings revealed distinct results for IT and OT systems, and the regression models varied in both predictive power and significance of the independent variables. Perceived benefit positively predicts deck officers cyber risk perception for both IT and OT systems, while trust, which included measures of social trust and confidence, was not found to be significant. Cyber security training and experience with cyber-attacks only influence deck officers’ perception of cyber risks related to operational technology. Practical implications of this work provide actionable recommendations for the maritime industry, including tailored risk communication tools, training programs, reporting systems, and holistic policies."

A modular cyber security training programme for the maritime domain,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00799-4,03 January 2024,"Aybars Oruc, Nabin Chowdhury, Vasileios Gkioulos","The global maritime industry is continuing the rapid digitization of systems and dependency on advancing technology, in a trend akin to other industrial domains. One of the main issues that this integration has brought is an increased vulnerability to a growing number of cyber threats. While several security measures are being implemented to prevent or respond to cyber attacks, the human element is still one of the main weaknesses. Many of today’s cyber attacks take advantage of human personnel’s lack of awareness, which makes cyber security awareness and training activities of critical importance. Unfortunately, current research is still limited in its offerings for cyber security training specific to maritime personnel. Moreover, such training programmes for the professionals should be developed role-based in accordance with the suggestions of many credited maritime organizations. For this reason, we developed a modular cyber security training programme for the maritime domain called Maritime Cyber Security (MarCy) by implementing Critical Events Model (CEM). Then, we evaluated the MarCy programme by utilizing the Delphi technique with the participation of 19 experts from academia and industry. In this study, we offer cyber security training for seafarers and office employees in shipping companies. We proposed eleven elective modules to improve the knowledge, skills, and attitude of learners against cyber risks. The MarCy programme can be implemented by universities, shipping companies, training institutes, and governmental organizations for maritime cyber security training purposes."
Proposing the future skill requirements for maritime cyber security,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10111-024-00760-y,04 April 2024,"Omer Soner, Cagatay Kandemir","In maritime transportation, many onboard ships operations have been digitalized. The usage and implementation of information systems has offered new opportunities while also introducing new types of risk. Cyber security is one of the most significant challenges that maritime information systems have faced. These most recent changes and technological developments necessitate the identification of new competencies and skillsets in order for seafarers to take steps to protect themselves and the assets they are responsible for against the consequences of cyber-attacks. The present study is aimed at determining the future skill requirements for maritime cyber security to fulfill the inconsistencies between current and actual marine transportation demands. In the paper, the skill requirements for cyber security are comprehensively analyzed in terms of information and operational technology implementations and their regulatory requirements. The AHP technique is then used to establish the priorities of three categories as well as the skills within each category. Considering the strong relations between seafarer training and maritime safety, determining future skill requirements will improve overall maritime safety and security. Therefore, the present study contributes to a great extent, not just to maritime safety literature but also to the maritime industry."
A systematic literature review of mitigating cyber security risk,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-023-01791-9,18 December 2023,"Syafila Kamarudin, Lian Tang, Jusang Bolong, Nor Azura Adzharuddin","Increasing internet consumption and constant technological development, specifically smartphones, have led to an increasingly urgent need for cyber awareness. Generally, smartphone cyber security is an established field and has inspired numerous relevant studies. Unfortunately, most past studies lacked focus on cyber security research in the form of a systematic literature search of smartphone use by the worldwide community. Therefore, this study reviewed past studies on mitigating cyber security risk in highly technology-dependent communities using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and the Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar online databases. The search strategy yielded 23 articles in total for inclusion in the systematic analysis. The thematic analysis yielded three themes: awareness, knowledge, and behavior, which in turn revealed 10 sub-themes. Finally, recommendations were suggested for reference by future scholars."
Cyber range design framework for cyber security education and training,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00680-4,18 March 2023,"M. N. Katsantonis, A. Manikas, I. Mavridis, D. Gritzalis","The need for effective training of cyber security personnel working in critical infrastructures and in the corporate has brought attention to the evolution of Cyber Ranges (CRs) as learning and training tools. Although CRs have been organized for many years, there is a lack of standards and common methodologies that facilitate their development and optimize their effectiveness. Aiming at strengthening cyber security education and research that utilize well designed CRs, we first analyze the CRs domain to identify key characteristics, strengths and fundamental weaknesses, and based on these outcomes we propose the Cyber Range Design Framework (CRDF), which includes the CR Architecture and the CR Life-Cycle. The CR Architecture presents the main components of CRDF compliant CRs, whereas the CR Life-Cycle presents the development phases of such approaches and the activities these phases embrace. CRDF builds on the Conceptual Framework for eLearning and Training (COFELET) and on the Exercise Life-Cycle. COFELET is particularly elaborated for the development of cyber security educational approaches, by adopting its design considerations that were based on widely adopted educational theories and approaches (e.g., scenario-based, reuse of elements). CRDF envisages the elaboration of CRs which optimize their impact, mitigate their weaknesses, and minimize their preparation and running costs. Under this prism, a preliminary appreciation of the CRDF approaches effectiveness is presented along with the expected outcomes of such approaches."
Cyber range scenario for smart grid security training,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00502-023-01146-0,14 July 2023,"Tomáš Lieskovan, David Kohout, Jakub Frolka","This paper discusses the development and use of a cyber range scenario for teaching cyber security in the energy sector, specifically in the smart grid. The scenario focuses on testing the DLMS standard for electricity metering using virtual smart meters and concentrators. The aim is to demonstrate the security issues of these devices, how they can be compromised, and to prevent the theft of sensitive personal data or, in extreme cases, even disconnection of the customer’s electricity. The paper describes the use of this scenario in a teaching context and highlights its importance in raising awareness of cyber security in the energy sector."
Cyber-Security awareness and its contribution towards sustainable human development: insights from the Zimbabwean context,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-024-00120-6,29 April 2024,"Colletor Tendeukai Chipfumbu, Theo Tsokota, Tendayi Marovah","Focusing on citizens’ awareness of cyber-security, this paper contributes to debates on ICTs and their contribution towards human development. The paper philosophically argues for the importance of cyber-security and cybercrime awareness in fostering sustainable human development through the responsible and meaningful use of ICT. Using the overarching values of the human development framework (empowerment, participation and sustainability), the paper assesses government ICT policy documents and subsequent initiatives such as the establishment of community information centres and integration of ICT in the education sector. This was done to establish the extent to which citizens have been provided with prerequisite knowledge and skills to deal with cyber-crime. It emerged from the study that regardless of the effort by the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) to enforce a law which encourage a cyber-security culture, awareness about cyber-security remains far below what can be expected in a cyber-world. As a result, if citizens’ lack cyber knowledge their freedom to be and do what they reasonably value on the Internet is continually threatened. The paper, thus, suggests the introduction of rigorous citizens’ awareness campaigns on cyber-crime and security to enable them to deal with unfounded fears and experiences that potentially limit their ability to deliberate, transact or act to be and freely do what they reasonably value."
Analysis of cyber security knowledge gaps based on cyber security body of knowledge,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-022-11261-8,05 August 2022,"Cagatay Catal, Alper Ozcan, Emrah Donmez, Ahmet Kasif","Due to the increasing number of cyber incidents and overwhelming skills shortage, it is required to evaluate the knowledge gap between cyber security education and industrial needs. As such, the objective of this study is to identify the knowledge gaps in cyber security graduates who join the cyber security workforce. We designed and performed an opinion survey by using the Cyber Security Knowledge Areas (KAs) specified in the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) that comprises 19 KAs. Our data was gathered from practitioners who work in cyber security organizations. The knowledge gap was measured and evaluated by acknowledging the assumption for employing sequent data as nominal data and improved it by deploying chi-squared test. Analyses demonstrate that there is a gap that can be utilized to enhance the quality of education. According to acquired final results, three key KAs with the highest knowledge gap are Web and Mobile Security, Security Operations and Incident Management. Also, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Software Lifecycles, and Vulnerabilities are the knowledge areas with largest difference in perception of importance between less and more experienced personnel. We discuss several suggestions to improve the cyber security curriculum in order to minimize the knowledge gaps. There is an expanding demand for executive cyber security personnel in industry. High-quality university education is required to improve the qualification of upcoming workforce. The capability and capacity of the national cyber security workforce is crucial for nations and security organizations. A wide range of skills, namely technical skills, implementation skills, management skills, and soft skills are required in new cyber security graduates. The use of each CyBOK KA in the industry was measured in response to the extent of learning in university environments. This is the first study conducted in this field, it is considered that this research can inspire the way for further researches."
"Study of smart grid cyber-security, examining architectures, communication networks, cyber-attacks, countermeasure techniques, and challenges",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42400-023-00200-w,02 May 2024,"Batoul Achaal, Mehdi Adda, Maxime Berger, Hussein Ibrahim, Ali Awde","Smart Grid (SG) technology utilizes advanced network communication and monitoring technologies to manage and regulate electricity generation and transport. However, this increased reliance on technology and connectivity also introduces new vulnerabilities, making SG communication networks susceptible to large-scale attacks. While previous surveys have mainly provided high-level overviews of SG architecture, our analysis goes further by presenting a comprehensive architectural diagram encompassing key SG components and communication links. This holistic view enhances understanding of potential cyber threats and enables systematic cyber risk assessment for SGs. Additionally, we propose a taxonomy of various cyberattack types based on their targets and methods, offering detailed insights into vulnerabilities. Unlike other reviews focused narrowly on protection and detection, our proposed categorization covers all five functions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework. This delivers a broad perspective to help organizations implement balanced and robust security. Consequently, we have identified critical research gaps, especially regarding response and recovery mechanisms. This underscores the need for further investigation to bolster SG cybersecurity. These research needs, among others, are highlighted as open issues in our concluding section."
Is cyber hygiene a remedy to IPTV infringement? A study of online streaming behaviours and cyber security practices,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00824-0,06 March 2024,"Rajiv Shah, Deniz Cemiloglu, Cagatay Yucel, Raian Ali, Vasilis Katos","Spurred by the rapid modernisation of the sector and the advent of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), audiovisual (AV) piracy is at epidemic levels, with interventions having limited effect. To date, the dominant themes in interventions have been around personal deterrence (i.e. the threat of legal action) and have not considered other factors that may influence an individual’s decision to consume infringing content. In this paper, we consider psychological factors, including perceptions around risk-taking, security behaviours, problematic internet use and personality traits, to gain a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing engagement with IPTV and the potential implications for cyber security. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with 283 participants living in the UK (age range 18–74, male 104), and an integrated structural equation model was constructed. Our findings showed a positive relationship between security behaviours and the perceived risk of viewing IPTV and a negative relationship between the dark personality triad and the perceived risk of viewing IPTV. They suggest that security behaviours fully mediate the relationship between problematic internet use and IPTV risk-taking, indicating a potential new path for anti-piracy interventions with greater efficacy."
A Multi-level Reference Model and a Dedicated Method for Cyber-Security by Design,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-024-00899-y,28 October 2024,"Sybren de Kinderen, Monika Kaczmarek-Heß, Simon Hacks","The increased reliance of organizations on information technology inherently increases their vulnerability to cyber-security attacks. As a response, a host of cyber-security approaches exists. While useful, these approaches exhibit shortcomings such as an inclination to be fragmented, not accounting for up-to-date organizational data, focusing on singular vulnerabilities only, and being reactive, i.e., focusing on patching up vulnerabilities in current systems. The paper presents and evaluates a modeling method aiming to address those shortcomings and to support security by design with a focus on the electricity sector. The proposed modeling method encompasses a multi-level reference model reconstructing and integrating existing initiatives and supporting top-down and bottom-up analyses. Compared to earlier work, the paper contributes (1) a process model for cyber-security by design, which proactively considers security as a first-class citizen during the design process, (2) a complete coverage of the multi-level model, in terms of three views complementing the introduced process model, (3) an elaborated evaluation, in terms of reporting on an additional design science cycle."
Integrating AI-driven threat intelligence and forecasting in the cyber security exercise content generation lifecycle,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00860-w,10 May 2024,"Alexandros Zacharis, Vasilios Katos, Constantinos Patsakis","The escalating complexity and impact of cyber threats require organisations to rehearse responses to cyber-attacks by routinely conducting cyber security exercises. However, the effectiveness of these exercises is limited by the exercise planners’ ability to replicate real-world scenarios in a timely manner that is, most importantly, tailored to the training audience and sector impacted. To address this issue, we propose the integration of AI-driven sectorial threat intelligence and forecasting to identify emerging and relevant threats and anticipate their impact in different industries. By incorporating such automated analysis and forecasting into the design of cyber security exercises, organisations can simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and assess their ability to respond to emerging threats. Fundamentally, our approach enhances the effectiveness of cyber security exercises by tailoring the scenarios to reflect the threats that are more relevant and imminent to the sector of the targeted organisation, thereby enhancing its preparedness for cyber attacks. To assess the efficacy of our forecasting methodology, we conducted a survey with domain experts and report their feedback and evaluation of the proposed methodology."

A review of time-series analysis for cyber security analytics: from intrusion detection to attack prediction,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00921-0,30 October 2024,"Max Landauer, Florian Skopik, Branka Stojanović, Andreas Flatscher, Torsten Ullrich","Understanding the current threat landscape as well as timely detection of imminent attacks are primary objectives of cyber security. Through time-series modeling of security data, such as event logs, alerts, or incidents, analysts take a step towards these goals. On the one hand, extrapolating time-series to predict future occurrences of attacks and vulnerabilities is able to support decision-making and preparation against threats. On the other hand, detection of model deviations as anomalies can point to suspicious outliers and thereby disclose cyber attacks. However, since the set of available techniques for time-series analysis is just as diverse as the research domains in the area of cyber security analytics, it can be difficult for analysts to understand which approaches fit the properties of security data at hand. This paper therefore conducts a broad literature review in research domains that leverage time-series analysis for cyber security analytics, with focus on available techniques, data sets, and challenges imposed by applications or feature properties. The results of our study indicate that relevant approaches range from detective systems ingesting short-term and low-level events to models that produce long-term forecasts of high-level attack cases."
AI hype as a cyber security risk: the moral responsibility of implementing generative AI in business,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00443-4,23 February 2024,"Declan Humphreys, Abigail Koay, Dennis Desmond, Erica Mealy","This paper examines the ethical obligations companies have when implementing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We point to the potential cyber security risks companies are exposed to when rushing to adopt generative AI solutions or buying into “AI hype”. While the benefits of implementing generative AI solutions for business have been widely touted, the inherent risks associated have been less well publicised. There are growing concerns that the race to integrate generative AI is not being accompanied by adequate safety measures. The rush to buy into the hype of generative AI and not fall behind the competition is potentially exposing companies to broad and possibly catastrophic cyber-attacks or breaches. In this paper, we outline significant cyber security threats generative AI models pose, including potential ‘backdoors’ in AI models that could compromise user data or the risk of ‘poisoned’ AI models producing false results. In light of these the cyber security concerns, we discuss the moral obligations of implementing generative AI into business by considering the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We identify two examples of ethical concern,overrelianceandover-trustin generative AI, both of which can negatively influence business decisions, leaving companies vulnerable to cyber security threats. This paper concludes by recommending a set of checklists for ethical implementation of generative AI in business environment to minimise cyber security risk based on the discussed moral responsibilities and ethical concern."
Implementation of a novel secured authentication protocol for cyber security applications,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-76306-z,28 October 2024,"V. Suresh Kumar, Osamah Ibrahim Khalaf, Radha Raman Chandan, Qusay Bsoul, Shashi Kant Gupta, Firas Zawaideh, Deema Mohammed Alsekait, Diaa Salama AbdElminaam","Robust verification protocols are crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of sensitive information due to the increasing complexity of cyber-attacks. This paper introduces a novel 5G Secure Handover Protocol aimed at addressing security and effectiveness issues encountered in existing systems. The proposed protocol is robust against various attacks, including de-synchronization, replay, man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of services (DoS), and jamming, ensures perfect forward key secrecy, safeguarding communication confidentiality. The proposed protocol utilizes a combination of spiking neural network and fuzzy logic (SNN-FL) techniques that must choose the goal cell as carefully as possible before initiating the transfer process. By combining fuzzy logic and spiking neural networks to reduce handover latency and thwart several types of cyberattacks, the proposed 5G Secure Handover Protocol improves security. Extensive simulations show its efficacy and emphasize its potential for safe communication in large-scale cybersecurity applications. The paper presents a novel secure authentication protocol that significantly reduces handover delays and improves efficiency. Simulations show its resilience against common security threats, protecting sensitive information and maintaining secure communication channels. The protocol, with low communication expenses, complex spatial, and latency for changeover verification, is ideal for large-scale cybersecurity applications, contributing to the development of secure digital authentication mechanisms."
DL-SkLSTM approach for cyber security threats detection in 5G enabled IIoT,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-023-01651-7,18 December 2023,"Anjali Rajak, Rakesh Tripathi","The advancement of 5G technology has enabled the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) to integrate artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge computing in real-time, leading to an improvement in industrial procedures in terms of efficiency. Despite the benefits of 5G technology for the IIoT, it also introduces new security risks and complexity to the control systems used in these ecosystems. Recent cyber-attacks are increasingly targeting vulnerable IoT devices, highlighting the need for enhanced security and privacy measures. To address this issue, this study proposes a 5G-based system that utilizes the DL-SkLSTM (Deep Learning- Stacked Long Short-Term Memory) based architecture to detect and classify the cyber-attack on a publicly accessible IIoT dataset, namely the Edge-IIoTset. SkLSTM is used to differentiate various cyberattacks. Finally, conducting a comprehensive analysis and comparison, we have identified that the proposed system outperforms several state-of-the-art DL and machine learning techniques."
The LeWiS Method: Target Variable Estimation Using Cyber Security Intelligence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-024-02744-1,18 April 2024,"Leigh Chase, Alaa Mohasseb, Benjamin Aziz","Information technology plays an increasingly important role in the provision of essential services. For these systems and networks to be reliable and trustworthy, we must defend them from those who would seek to compromise their confidentiality, integrity and availability. Security intelligence tells us about the tactics, techniques and procedures used by threat actors for these very purposes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for learning malicious behaviours and then estimating how likely it is that a system has been compromised. One of the difficulties encountered when applying machine learning to cyber security, is the lack of ground truth on which to train supervised techniques. This is often compounded by the volume, variety and velocity of data which is far greater than can be processed using only human analyses. The technique known as LeWiS, created and described by the authors, includes data preparation and processing phases that learn and later predict the presence of threat actors using a model of their behaviours. The method addresses the problems of scale and veracity, by learning indicators of attack via feature extraction from security intelligence that has been obtained through empirical methods. This approach shows promising classification performance for detecting learned malicious behaviours, within synthesised systems’ event data."

Securing the remote office: reducing cyber risks to remote working through regular security awareness education campaigns,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00809-5,29 January 2024,"Giddeon Njamngang Angafor, Iryna Yevseyeva, Leandros Maglaras","Cyber security threats, including risks to remote workers, are varied and diverse, with the number of scams and business email compromise breaches increasing. Firms and their staff are experiencing mass phishing attacks, several typical precursors to more sinister attacks like cyber-enabled fraud, ransomware, and denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Threat actors are leveraging new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver sophisticated scam and phishing messages that are challenging for users to identify as malicious. Several businesses are increasing technical efforts in critical areas, including network hardening, robust patching, anti-malware, ransomware detection applications, and multi-factor authentication to detect, prevent, and recover from potential threats. Despite that, these measures provide only a partial solution if the users who access the systems do not have good security awareness training. In this study, we review some cyber risks related to remote working and detail how they can be remediated through regular security awareness education campaigns (SAECs). The study presents the results of a proof of concept (PoC) experiment conducted to establish the value of regular SAECs in the fight against scams and phishing attacks against remote workers. The pilot results confirm that securing the remote office requires a robust SAEC. It argues that to be successful and help staff protect business systems and data, SAECs must be regular and varied, providing opportunities for staff to understand what to look for in suspicious scams and phishing emails. Moreover, they must provide opportunities for staff to practice their knowledge and understanding through practical exercises such as spam and phishing simulation exercises, which could help users avoid falling victim to spam and phishing emails."
Blockchain-based cyber-security trust model with multi-risk protection scheme for secure data transmission in cloud computing,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-024-04481-9,16 April 2024,"Mohd Akbar, Mohammed Mujtaba Waseem, Syeda Husna Mehanoor, Praveen Barmavatu","The rise of cloud computing has transformed the way data is stored and managed, yet it has also brought about major security issues, especially concerning the secure transfer of data within cloud systems. In response to these challenges, this research develops a comprehensive cyber-security trust model that provides multi-risk protection for secure data transmission in cloud computing, ensuring the highest level of privacy and data security. This innovative approach aims to ensure the secure transmission of data in cloud computing while harnessing the combined strengths of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Advanced Encryption Algorithm. As cloud environments become integral to modern business operations, safeguarding data against a multitude of security risks, including traditional and emerging threats, is paramount. The Cyber-Security Trust Model leverages blockchain to establish a transparent and tamper-resistant ledger of all data transactions within the cloud. This blockchain layer enhances data integrity, auditability, and traceability while also providing a decentralized and trust-based framework for authentication and authorization. The Multi-Risk Protection Model incorporates both Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and a Modified Advanced Encryption Standard (MAES) to offer multi-layered defence mechanisms. Through rigorous testing and analysis, this study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed Cyber-Security Trust Model with a Merkle tree-based solution for data integrity verification. It makes a significant impact on the field of secure data transmission in cloud computing by providing strong protection against a constantly changing set of security threats. MATLAB is employed to conduct rigorous experiments, analyse results, and validate the model’s performance in various cloud computing scenarios. The findings of the proposed study show the proposed method, combining Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Modified AES (MAES), stands out with exceptional performance, featuring encryption and decryption times of 2.25ms and 1.071ms, respectively. The proposed system outperforms all others, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of 99.84%. This research signifies a ground-breaking advancement in cloud computing security, addressing a spectrum of traditional and emerging threats through a multi-risk protection model incorporating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and MAES while demonstrating exceptional performance in rigorous experiments."
A personalized learning theory-based cyber-security training exercise,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00704-z,02 June 2023,"Nabin Chowdhury, Vasileios Gkioulos","Current enterprises’ needs for skilled cyber-security (CS) professionals have prompted the development of diverse CS training programs and offerings. It has been noted that even though enterprise staff is now more aware of security threats, the number of successful attacks against companies has all but decreased over the years. Several criticisms were raised against current CS training offerings, which often made them inadequate, or unable to change participants’ behavior and security attitude. One of the main factors CS training programs are often not very effective is the lack of engagement or motivation of participants. This is often the result of training not being tailored to the needs or preferences of participants. In our previous work, we tackled this issue by developing a personalized learning theory-based model for developing CS training frameworks. In this work, we utilize the model to develop two CS training exercises: two game-based scenarios using the CS training video game Cyber CIEGE and one table-top team exercise. The exercises are later tested by involving a group of 12 students from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU) Information Security master’s degree program. According to the results of the experiment and the feedback from the students, students felt more engaged during the exercises due to having been participants in their development process. This has in turn motivated them to continue using the training tools independently in their spare time. Further research is recommended to establish whether the training development model is adequate for different target groups, as well as better performing than other models when developing full-fledged training programs."

A Comprehensive Review on Deep Learning Techniques on Cyber Attacks on Cyber Physical Systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-024-03253-x,20 September 2024,"Maloth Sagar, C. Vanmathi","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which integrate control, computing, and communication, are considered as next-generation intelligent systems.A major concern in CPS is to ensure security. If security is not ensured, then it leads to both property damage and casualties.Since CPS is closely associated with real life, it is a hot research area in present security research. Nevertheless, cyber security issues are also raised. More efforts are still required for understanding CPS security from a more comprehensive perspective even though there are several studies on CPS cybersecurity.To identify and detect cyber security in CPS, numerous methods have been applied. The majority of recently published studies focused on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, with little attention paid to the development of Deep Learning (DL). Hence, the analysis of cyber security on CPS utilizing several algorithms of DL techniques is systematically reviewed.The appropriate cyber security risk levels and their corresponding detection and mitigation processesare determined. This study could augment the adaptability of the system of CPS data. Also, it could increase the generalization of the models of security attacks in CPS. Using DL algorithms is strongly recommended by most authors as a means to identify cyber security issues in CPS.The CNN-centric LSTM, Deep Multi-architectural Approach, and DL-Meta classifier attained the highest accuracy in the detection rate of cyber security attacks in CPS when analogized with the other algorithms in DL techniques. Hence, for several critical systems in CPSs, the result renders clear guidelines to apply other regularization on DL techniques."

However, the relevant literature on cyber security for in-vehicle communication systems does not currently offer any targeted, workable solutions for in-vehicle cyber hazards. Current solutions usually rely on protocol-specific security techniques rather than providing a comprehensive security framework for in-vehicle communication. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are emergent systems that use a cyber-communication infrastructure to enable efficient real-time control and collaboration (C&C) of physical components, such as actuators, sensors, control systems, and the surrounding environment. This study analyses how smart cities are transported using machine learning models in 6G networks to analyse cyber security through vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In this case, vehicle-to-vehicle communication uses 6G networks that are built on the Internet of Things. Subsequently, reinforcement quantile spatial convolutional neural networks (RQSCNN) are used to perform the cyber security analysis. Throughput, Quality of Service (QoS), latency, computational cost, data transfer rate are all considered in experimental investigation. As a result, the suggested model can be applied in high-speed, high-throughput internal communication contexts of automobiles and accurately characterise both the nature and presence or absence of attacks."

Smart vehicles networks: BERT self-attention mechanisms for cyber-physical system security,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13198-023-02065-1,27 July 2023,Sultan Mesfer Aldossary,"People can freely communicate on a travel-related subject over the internet through IoT on smart vehicles to maintain their interpersonal relationships. Cyber security challenges are brought on by the rising use of smart vehicle communications and information. Attackers use the chance to fabricate communications to obtain users’ personal information from smart vehicles. It is a significant duty to distinguish genuine postings from phishing messages and violence among the millions of messages on smart vehicle networks. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) method with self-attention is proposed in this paper to process textual threats, vulnerability data, and cyber-attacks. The BERT-SA model is fine-tuned to enhance performance. The self-attention method of a proposed model determines the contextual relationships among words in a text input, i.e., governs the relative reputation of each word in the phrase by examining its exact placement inside the sentence. This model’s primary goal is to accurately carry out tasks specialized in cyber-security. The BERT model performs better than other neural networks models like CNN, RNN, and LSTM. Sentiment140, T4SA datasets are used to assess the effectiveness of the BERT model. The experimental results show that the proposed model enhances the accuracy by up to 96.65%."
Improving patient centric data retrieval and cyber security in healthcare: privacy preserving solutions for a secure future,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-18253-5,31 January 2024,"S. Arunprasath, Suresh Annamalai","The healthcare industry is increasingly reliant on access to large volumes of patient data, which is critical for improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and ensuring regulatory compliance. However, there are significant challenges facing healthcare organizations in retrieving patient data from databases and ensuring the security and privacy of this data. Addressing these challenges is vital to the future success of the healthcare industry. This paper proposes two solutions to these challenges: a simplified ontology-based retrieval algorithm for healthcare multimedia data to enhance the retrieval process, and Hierarchical learning: ensemble model-based reinforcement learning to improve patient data security. An ontology-based retrieval algorithm was a method used to retrieve relevant information from large datasets. It filtered out irrelevant data and provided contextually relevant results. Hierarchical learning involved organizing learning tasks in a hierarchical structure, with higher-level policies guiding lower-level policies. Ensemble model-based reinforcement learning combined multiple models to improve the performance of a reinforcement learning system. The Simplified Ontology-Based Retrieval Algorithm had excellent performance with an accuracy of 92%, making it highly effective in information retrieval tasks. The paper highlights the importance of using advanced technologies and prioritizing cyber security in healthcare to maintain trust and optimal patient care. Cutting-edge technologies transformed healthcare by enhancing patient data retrieval and cyber security. Examples included encrypted computations, multi-party privacy, query result anonymization, real-time monitoring through IoMT, and secure data sharing. Adopting these solutions ultimately contributed to the protection of sensitive patient data and the overall security of healthcare organizations."

By linking these devices, medical monitoring, analysis, and reporting may become more intelligent and autonomous, ultimately benefiting the patient. To solve these problems, a thorough plan for monitoring and assessing method health needs to be formulated. The application of traditional machine learning to massive datasets in a shared computing environment may lead to model training and computation that is either too slow to provide accurate results or too fast to produce erroneous results as a consequence of rushed training, both of which are detrimental. Key 6G enablers may be seen of as the upcoming paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing, and quantum ML (QML), as well as their synergies with communication networks. This research presents a new machine learning approach to medical cyber physical system (CPS) predictive maintenance using swarm robots. In this case, we use fog computing-integrated soft sensors to conduct a thorough closed-loop dynamic analysis of the CPS predictive maintenance. Extreme learning utilising a weighted sliding window. The investigation of medical security is then conducted using a kernel decision making system based on probabilistic swarm robotics. In terms of training accuracy, energy use, convergence ratio, precision, and F_measure, an experimental study is conducted.

Typically this is a manual process carried out by consultants or working groups with little or no software support outside of spreadsheet tools. As cybersecurity threats and digital systems themselves become more complex and dynamic, there is a need for greater tool support in the risk assessment process to document and trace assumptions and facilitate the revision or extension of a threat and risk assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle. The Cyber Security Argument Graph Evaluation (CyberSAGE) tool provides a platform for model-based cybersecurity analysis of cyber failure and attack scenarios. It combines models of high-level workflow, system architecture, device properties, attacker capability and skill, to compute holistic, quantitative security metrics. In this paper we describe the models, algorithms, and software architecture of the CyberSAGE tool. To illustrate its application, we describe an assessment carried out on communication systems in two railway lines with the support of an industry partner. Finally, we summarize feedback on the CyberSAGE tool from the railway case study partner, as well as over 40 interviews with practitioners and domain experts and a multinational electronics company who carried out a one year independent evaluation."

Due to attack cost restrictions, the linked channels are subject to a limit on the number of continuous DoS attacks. A proactive security control method is then developed to combat two-channel DoS attacks, depending on a method for identifying IoT intrusions. Using the CICIDS dataset for attack detection, we examined the effectiveness of the Deep Convolutional Network Model (DCNM), a suggested deep learning model. The addressed CPS can be asymptotically stable against DoS assaults under the security controller's active security control technique without sacrificing control performance. Recent tests and simulations show how effective the security control strategy is active.

As such, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the fields that have significantly adopted the CPS approach to improving people's lives in smart cities by reducing energy consumption and air pollution. Therefore, autonomous vehicle-cyber physical systems (AV-CPSs) have attracted enormous investments from major corporations and are projected to be widely used. However, AV-CPS is vulnerable to cyber and physical threat vectors due to the deep integration of information technology (IT), including cloud computing, with the communication process. Cloud computing is critical in providing the scalable infrastructure required for real-time data processing, storage, and analysis in AV-CPS, allowing these systems to work seamlessly in smart cities. CPS components such as sensors and control systems through network infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks targeted by attackers using the communication system. This paper proposes an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) for AV-CPS using transfer learning to identify cyberattacks launched against connected physical components of AVs through a network infrastructure. First, AV-CPS was developed by implementing the controller area network (CAN) and integrating it into the AV simulation model. Second, the dataset was generated from the AV-CPS. The collected dataset was then preprocessed to be trained and tested via pre-trained CNNs. Third, eight pre-trained networks were implemented, namely, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet.

The number and diversity of such attacks against Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasing at impressive rates.

However, existing risk assessment methods do not consider this specific characteristic of CPSs. In this paper, we propose a dependency-based, domain-agnostic cybersecurity risk assessment method that leverages a model of the CPS under study that captures dependencies among the system components. The proposed method identifies possible attack paths against critical components of a CPS by taking an attacker’s viewpoint and prioritizes these paths according to their risk to materialize, thus allowing the defenders to define efficient security controls. We illustrate the workings of the proposed method by applying it to a case study of a CPS in the energy domain, and we highlight the advantages that the proposed method offers when used to assess cybersecurity risks in CPSs."

This study aims to improve the identification and mitigation of cyber risks in these systems by introducing the Socio-Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) architecture. The suggested SCPS framework combines social behaviour analytics, physical network monitoring, and powerful artificial intelligence to establish a comprehensive and flexible security system. The proposed method processes the brand marketing area, such as Alluring ads, and the SCPS helps to identify the cyber-attacks in ads. Initially, it collects the URL structure dataset and pre-processes the data. Then, the SCPS is integrated with the system to identify any attacks in the URL dataset. Next, the dataset will be trained using deep learning methods such as Deep Maxout Network (DMN). An experimental setup in a fictitious brand communication network shows how well the system recognises and reacts to different types of cyberattacks. The SCPS framework is a new strategy that contributes to digital marketing administration and cyber security by bringing together the social, technological, and physical domains to protect digital marketing assets. The evaluation of the trial showed effective and precise detection of phishing attacks. According to the performance evaluation, the DMN algorithm beat other applied models with a maximum accuracy and precision of 96% during the training and 93% during the testing phases. Based on URL, text, and image attributes, the algorithms distinguished between phishing and authentic websites with these precision values.

The event-triggered scheme (ETS) is being developed to relieve more network burdens. A Luenburger observer is used to estimate the unmeasured states. In this work, the hybrid cyber attack is addressed, which contains deception attacks and DoS attacks. It is anticipated that input control signals sent across a network are vulnerable to hybrid cyber-attacks in which adversaries could inject fake data into the control signals. Since system state information is usually not fully known, an observer-based controller is built to stabilize the system and keep the right performance index even when hybrid cyber-attacks happen. By solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the controllers and observers are also obtained. Lastly, inverted pendulum applications are shown to show how well and realistically the theoretical results can be used to respond to and get rid of the effects of hybrid cyber-attacks."

These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)—cloud, and US standards—The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation’s. Despite this significant impact to individuals and society, cybersecurity standards and financial governance regulations are still in their infancy, specifically in the UK."

Several techniques are used to detect whether the data is phished or non-phished. Some anti-phishing software is used to identify the phishing data. However, few of these techniques did not provide efficient performance. Hence, the proposed model is introduced to overcome the issues obtained and improve the efficiency of detecting whether the data is phished or non-phished. The data is gathered from the Phishstorm dataset, which is pre-processed using the Z score normalization method and data cleaning. Data balancing is done by the Advanced synthetic sampling approach (Adv-SyN) to balance the dataset, and the features are extracted using a Double self-sparse autoencoder (DSelSa). The Opposition Gazelle optimization algorithm (OpGoA) model is used for optimal feature selection, and finally, the data is classified using Multi Head Depth wise Tern integrated long short term memory (MDepthNet). The sooty tern optimization is used to evaluate the loss function of the network model. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed based on some evaluation metrics and compared with other models, which describes the efficiency of the proposed model. The main objective of proposed technique used to detect the phishing attack and phishing or non-phishing. An automated DL methodology introduced for effective detection of phishing attacks for enhancing the cyber security. The accuracy of the proposed model is obtained as 99.45%, and Precision is 99.45%. RMSE and MSE rate of the proposed model is reduced to 0.73 and 0.05 for better performance."

Cyber security analysis based medical image encryption in cloud IoT network using quantum deep learning model,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-023-06076-x,27 January 2024,Jing Wang,"A very high degree of security is required for the transmission of medical pictures via open access as these images are more important than other types of images in most applications, especially real-time applications like telemedicine. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made the privacy and security of patient medical picture data an urgent issue in the field of image privacy protection. By combining quantum deep learning with cyber security research of cloud IoT networks, this study proposes a novel approach to encrypting medical photos.

From scattered data to actionable knowledge: flexible cyber security reporting in the military domain,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-022-00613-7,14 September 2022,"Florian Skopik, Arndt Bonitz, Volker Grantz, Günter Göhler","Numerous cyber situational awareness models have been proposed in recent years. Yet, one of the main challenges still remains mostly unsolved, which is what information sources contribute to the process for establishing cyber situational awareness and how is relevant information collected. While previous scientific works focused on situational awareness models and decision support based on common operating pictures, ingesting and maintaining a consistent data basis for the cyber domain has rarely been studied in detail. However, this is crucial when data distributed across different systems need to be collected, vetted, correlated, de-duplicated, enriched and finally stored as a basis for flexible cyber security reporting. In this paper, we design an approach and a data model that enable to ingest and store the essential information from disparate organizational units and act as a basis for the flexible creation of cyber security reports. We describe the application of this approach and model in a case study together with the Austrian Ministry of Defense (MoD), in which we surveyed existing data sources and transfer paths and rated the applicability of the CCOP data model and accompanying processes in course of a proof-of-concept implementation."

We examine the cyber-security and risky Internet behaviors of undergraduate students from Pakistan, taking into account the diversity of these students in terms of demographics, socioeconomic status, and the digital divide. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire. A total of 294 students belonging to six different cities of Pakistan were surveyed employing multistage stratified sampling in face-to-face interaction. The results indicated significant differences of cyber-security posture in terms of gender, age and digital divide variables. The profiles of students based on cyber-security and risky Internet behaviors indicate three groups with a majority of them falling into group that exhibits more risk-averse yet low cyber-security behavior. Moreover, proactive cyber-security awareness behavior has a positive impact on high risk-averse behavior. The implications of the findings are studied in terms of providing customized training and awareness.

Hyper-heuristic multi-objective online optimization for cyber security in big data,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13198-022-01727-w,17 July 2022,"Mohammed Ahmed, G. Rama Mohan Babu","The tremendous growth in data inside the Big data era has created data management challenges as well as data security concerns. These large data cyber security challenges can be successfully addressed with AI computations, with the SVM providing the best results on big data order issues. Master information in picking the kernel work and different boundaries is required to characterize the correct design of the SVM, and this can significantly advance its arrangement outcomes. The fake positive rate, bogus negative rate, and model unpredictability boundaries addressed using the SVM arrangement process is shown to be a multi-objective optimization problem in this study. The hyper-heuristic online particle swarm optimization (HHOPSO) computation with the SVM multi-objective optimization problem, a hyper-heuristic online particle swarm optimization system is produced was presented. The hyper-heuristic system comprises a high-level technique for directing the search process for determining low-level heuristics, and the low-level heuristics build new SVM setup configurations using various PSO standards. The proposed HHOPSO was evaluated on two cyber security datasets i.e., NSL-KDD and ISCX-IDS. The results revealed that the suggested approach is more effective than other calculations in refining the order of big data cyber security issues.

Proposed cancelable biometrics system based on hybrid optical crypto-steganography audio framework for cyber security applications,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-18232-w,08 July 2024,Mai Helmy,"Biometric authentication systems have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their high level of security and convenience. Cancelable biometrics is a promising area of research that addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with traditional biometric systems. By transforming the biometric data in a non-invertible manner, cancelable biometrics offer enhanced privacy protection, increased security, and the flexibility to revoke or update biometric templates. As research in this field continues to advance, cancelable biometrics has the potential to revolutionize the way biometric systems are implemented and utilized. Ten years ago, there is a dire need to develop new cancelable biometric systems depending on cryptography or steganography system which may merging the two previous techniques to hide secret information within a cover medium. It involves encrypting the message and then embedding it into an innocent-looking file, such as an image or audio file. The goal is to make the hidden message undetectable to anyone who is not the intended recipient. This method ensures that even if the cover medium is intercepted, the secret information remains secure. Crypto-steganography is a powerful tool for covert communication and has applications in various fields, including intelligence agencies, cyber-security, and digital multimedia applications. In a classical cryptography system, users can easily change their password if they are compromised. However, user's biometrics is limited and unique, and if they are compromised, it will be impossible to change them as it in cryptography system. So, the basic concept of cancelable biometrics is to use another version of the original biometric template created through a one-way transform or a crypto-steganography scheme to keep the original biometrics safe and away from utilization in the system. Cancelable biometrics depends on the transformation of data so that users can replace their single biometric template in the same or different system. In this paper, a biometric system is presented as a novel hybrid optical crypto-steganography algorithm which is used to achieve cancelability option over audios signal. A proposal hybrid crypto-steganography technique based on the optical Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE) algorithm which is suggested to attain simultaneous encryption of multi-audios, begins with encrypting the biometric audios using the optical DRPE algorithm, then the resulting encrypted biometric audios are further encrypted again with the chaotic Baker map as a permutation strategy, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and Ron's Code (RC6) as a diffusion strategy. Then, the resulting encrypted biometrics is embedded into the cover media with a steganography technique which is based on a chaotic concept. Finally, the quality evaluation of the proposed cancelable biometrics system reveals good performance. The simulation results prove that the suggested hybrid optical crypto-steganography framework is reliable and presents recommended security and robustness levels for its utilization in achieving efficient cancelable biometrics systems compared to traditional techniques."

In spite of their various benefits, CPS frameworks are inclined to different digital and additionally actual security dangers, assaults and difficulties. This is because of their heterogeneous nature, their dependence on private information, and their enormous scope arrangement. Thus, purposeful or unplanned openings of these frameworks can result in calamitous impacts, which makes it basic to set up vigorous safety efforts.

The increasing complexity surrounding the innate characteristics of the shipping industry makes it challenging to build a resilient framework for ensuring cyber security. This study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for assessing cyber security risk in the autonomous shipping context. The research was validated through surveying subject matter experts, system designers and seafarers. Different types of equipment and systems are ranked based on their perceived vulnerability to cyber threats. Survey data from 28 subject matter experts are collected and analysed through the Bayesian best–worst method (BWM). At system level, the results indicate that navigational systems are the most vulnerable to potential cyber threats, while propulsion systems are the least vulnerable element in the context of future autonomous shipping operations. On a sub-system level, the three most vulnerable parts are Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) and the communication devices on shore control centres (SCC), while the least vulnerable parts are engine controls, SCC integration platforms and cargo handling at ports."

However, consumer data stored within the IoT infrastructure is susceptible to cyber-security risks. Government regulations mandate that platforms invest in IoT cyber-defense improvements, necessitating supply chain collaboration. Motivated by this observation, this study seeks to determine when platforms should enhance IoT cyber-defense levels and assess the impact of such improvements on the e-commerce supply chain under government regulations. We develop a stylized game-theoretic model and conduct a comparative analysis to investigate firms’ equilibrium decisions. Numerical studies are also performed to validate our results. Our findings reveal that setting a higher IoT functionality level benefits manufacturers through enhanced cyber-defense. Additionally, even when the cost of cyber-defense improvement is negligible, platforms may not economically benefit from such improvements if the unit penalty is high and defense efforts are low. Finally, we find that cyber-defense improvements can generate a win-win outcome for manufacturers, platforms, and consumers when defense efforts are high and the cost of improvement is low. Our results suggest that manufacturers should invest more in IoT when cyber-security risks are effectively mitigated. Platforms must carefully weigh the penalty, defense level, and cyber-defense improvement costs in their cyber-security investments. Furthermore, to ensure that cyber-defense improvements benefit social welfare, governments are advised to judiciously set penalties, particularly when defense levels are low."

Data management is characterized as acquiring data to make better business decisions; data about a corporation is processed, secured, and stored. In the early notion, there were connected contrivances and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions, and transaction data is recorded on the Blockchain. Security is a challenging subject that must be carefully considered throughout a CSP's design and development phases. By focusing on such issues while taking into account the traditional characteristics of IoT/ IIoT-predicated environments, we proposed a Secure and Distributed Framework for Resource Management (SDFRM) in Industry 4.0 environments within a distributed and collaborative Industry 4.0 system, the dynamic and trust-based Distributed Management Framework (DMF) of shared resource access, in this research article. Furthermore, to offer strong privacy assurances for Access Control (AC)-equivalent actions, a privacy-preserving approach is devised and implemented into the Distributed Management Framework (DMF). Based on blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks, the recommended DMF provides for dynamic access control and system governance without relying on third-party vulnerabilities. A privacy-preserving technique is presented and implemented into the DMF to give adequate privacy safeguards for AC-related processes.

We point out that an organisation’s situation awareness in cyberspace is a phenomena fundamentally distinct from the original conception of situation awareness, requiring continuous data exchange and knowledge management where the standard orchestration mechanisms require significant policy attention in light of the AI-driven automation of social engineering operations. We conceptualise cyber situation awareness as a socio-technical phenomena with Syntactic, Semantic, and Operatic dimensions—each subject to a number of stressors which are exacerbated under the growing threat of Malicious Social Automation in cyber security environments. The article further contributes to the ideas of developing situational awareness in cyberspace as being essentially a knowledge management exercise and characterises the threat data governance challenges therein to address the increasingly social and often pervasive automation in our digital societies."

Like high false positive rates, attack reoccurrence, and increases in numerous attacks. To overcome this problem, we use explainable (DL) techniques to increase cyber security in an IoT-enabled smart organization environment. This paper firstly, implements Capsule Network (CapsNet) to process employee fingerprints and blink patterns. Secondly, the Quantum Key Secure Communication Protocol (QKSCP) was also used to decrease communication channel vulnerabilities like Man In The Middle (MITM) and reply attacks. After Dual Q Network-based Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm DQN-A3C algorithm detects and prevents attacks. Thirdly, employed the explainable DQN-A3C model and the Siamese Inter Lingual Transformer (SILT) transformer for natural language explanations to boost social engineering security by ensuring the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model and human trustworthiness. After, we built a Hopping Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS/IPS) using an explainable Harmonized Google Net (HGN) model with SHAP and SILT explanations to appropriately categorize dangerous external traffic flows. Finally, to improve global, cyberattack comprehension, we created a Federated Learning (FL)-based knowledge-sharing mechanism between Cyber Threat Repository (CTR) and cloud servers, known as global risk assessment. To evaluate the suggested approach, the new method is compared to the ones that already exist in terms of malicious traffic (65 bytes/sec), detection rate (97%), false positive rate (45%), prevention accuracy (98%), end-to-end response time (97 s), recall (96%), false negative rate (42%) and resource consumption (41). Our strategy's performance is examined using numerical analysis, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms other methods in all metrics."

These texts include not only security concepts, incidents, tools, guidelines, and policies, but also risk management approaches, best practices, assurances, technologies, and more. Through the integration of large-scale, heterogeneous, unstructured cyber security information, the identification and classification of cyber security entities can help handle cyber security issues. Due to the complexity and diversity of texts in the cyber security domain, it is difficult to identify security entities in the cyber security domain using the traditional named entity recognition (NER) methods. This paper describes various approaches and techniques for NER in this domain, including the rule-based approach, dictionary-based approach, and machine learning based approach, and discusses the problems faced by NER research in this domain, such as conjunction and disjunction, non-standardized naming convention, abbreviation, and massive nesting. Three future directions of NER in cyber security are proposed: (1) application of unsupervised or semi-supervised technology; (2) development of a more comprehensive cyber security ontology; (3) development of a more comprehensive deep learning model."

Steganography is the type of security which used to hide the user data into a cover medium while observing the least possible statistical detectability. Cryptography is a schedule in which the data is decoded into encrypted form and distributes them, so both are used to assure security and privacy.

Enhancing IoT cyber attacks intrusion detection through GAN-based data augmentation and hybrid deep learning models for MQTT network protocol cyber attacks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-024-04752-5,04 November 2024,"Hayette Zeghida, Mehdi Boulaiche, Ramdane Chikh, Alwi M. Bamhdi, Ana Luiza Bessa Barros, Djamel Zeghida, Ahmed Patel","In the evolving digital landscape, interconnected IoT networks are expanding fast. However, essential security measures are often lacking, which makes it vulnerable to cyber threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are crucial in combating these threats, but IDSs in the IoT domain face significant challenges; one of them is the existence of imbalanced data, where attack activities are underrepresented compared to normal activities. This becomes a problem when handling Machine Learning (ML) tasks to improve the system’s intrusion detection ability. This paper presents a novel solution by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create balanced datasets. Unlike traditional methods, our approach generates high-quality synthetic samples that maintain the intricate characteristics of the data, making it possible to improve detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce three specialized IDSs designed to detect attacks on the lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, utilizing hybrid Deep Learning (DL) algorithms (CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-GRU). Experimental results, using a combination of both the original MQTT dataset and a newly generated dataset through GANs, demonstrate the better performance of the generated datasets in multi-class classification. This performance highlights the effectiveness of our GAN-based approach in improving detection accuracy at the same time that it reduces false positives. The ultimate objective is to develop an autonomous system tailored to safeguard IoT environments, providing a robust and adaptable solution to emerging cyber threats."

An intelligent dynamic cyber physical system threat detection system for ensuring secured communication in 6G autonomous vehicle networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-70835-3,05 September 2024,"Shanthalakshmi M, Ponmagal R S","Smart cities have developed advanced technology that improves people’s lives. A collaboration of smart cities with autonomous vehicles shows the development towards a more advanced future. Cyber-physical system (CPS) are used blend the cyber and physical world, combined with electronic and mechanical systems, Autonomous vehicles (AVs) provide an ideal model of CPS. The integration of 6G technology with Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) marks a significant advancement in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), offering enhanced self-sufficiency, intelligence, and effectiveness. Autonomous vehicles rely on a complex network of sensors, cameras, and software to operate. A cyber-attack could interfere with these systems, leading to accidents, injuries, or fatalities. Autonomous vehicles are often connected to broader transportation networks and infrastructure. A successful cyber-attack could disrupt not only individual vehicles but also public transportation systems, causing widespread chaos and economic damage. Autonomous vehicles communicate with other vehicles (V2V) and infrastructure (V2I) for safe and efficient operation. If these communication channels are compromised, it could lead to collisions, traffic jams, or other dangerous situations. So we present a novel approach to mitigating these security risks by leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for dynamic cyber-attack detection within the cyber-physical systems (CPS) framework of AVs. The proposed Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IIDS) employs a combination of advanced learning techniques, including Data Fusion, One-Class Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor, to improve detection accuracy. The study demonstrates that the EfficientNet model achieves superior performance with an accuracy of up to 99.97%, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance the security of AV networks. This research contributes to the development of intelligent cyber-security models that align with 6G standards, ultimately supporting the safe and efficient integration of AVs into smart cities."

Governments, state-sponsored actors, and non-state sponsored actors have used cyber-attacks as the “weapon of choice” due to their specific characteristics. Cyber-attacks can be highly targeted and focused, even tailored to a specific unit or system, providing limited to no physical destruction (unlike a cruise missile) and potentially resulting in no loss of life. There are several incident response frameworks and approaches that an organization can implement to enhance its security posture. Usually, these will address specific adverse events such as computer security incidents, which in turn are limited in scope and coverage, typically within an organization. Nations have made limited effort in confronting severe cyber-attacks targeting and/or threatening them, as well as in preventing these attacks from being launched. In this work, we identify and discuss a decision-taking framework that may allow state actors to adopt new options against severe cyber-attacks, not always complying with international norms. Such options are neither encouraged nor supported. On the contrary, we discuss them so that the international community is made aware of such potential frameworks. More specifically, by defining clear thresholds, roles, and responsibilities, by introducing a structured chain of command, and by identifying the potential of certain actions, policy makers can recognize an extended decision space that may lead to unpredictable deterrence options against cyber-attacks."
A Tullock-contest-based approach for cyber security investments,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-022-04958-z,14 September 2022,"David Iliaev, Sigal Oren, Ella Segev","We study a cyber security game between a defender who wishes to defend her information assets and an attacker who tries to attack them. In this game the attacker and the defender choose how to distribute their resources in attacking or defending the different information assets. Given these investments the probability that an attack on a given asset is successful is an increasing function of the attacker’s investment and a decreasing function of the defender’s investment. The defender tries to minimize the expected damage from the attacks plus the cost of the defense while the attacker tries to maximize the expected damage from attacks minus his attacks’ expenses. The attacker is constrained by a budget. We compare two scenarios: a sequential move game and a simultaneous game. In the sequential game the defender moves first by deciding how much resources to allocate to the defense of each information asset and the attacker observes these investments and responds by allocating his resources in a manner that maximizes his expected utility. In the simultaneous game the attacker does not observe the defender’s decision before making his own. We analyze the best response strategies of the players and the equilibria of each of these games. Based on this analysis, we provide a tight upper bound on the reduction in defender’s costs that can be achieved by moving from the simultaneous to the sequential game."

Aruna Sri, Papiya Dutta, Ali Rizwan, Prashanth Venkatareddy","As a result of recent advancements in electronics technology, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) may now make use of a vast array of tiny sensors (WSN). WSN are viewed as problematic networks because of the environments in which they may operate and the technology they rely on. For instance, routing protocols need to be prepared for and capable of recovering from unexpected events like node failures and packet losses. The dynamic nature of these routing environments necessitates that every WSN routing protocol have mechanisms for adapting to new conditions. In many applications, security affects performance and energy efficiency. To provide such security services, we require resilient key management techniques. Security Power Aware Routing-Salp Swarm Optimization (SPAR-SSO) protocol uses a unique cryptosystem. SPAR-SSO uses connection quality estimation and power aware routing to reduce power consumption and delay while increasing packet delivery ratio. WSNs must conserve energy because the nodes are battery-powered. If the route with the greatest energy savings is constantly chosen for delivery, the nodes along this route will be overused and drained quickly, leading to network partitioning. In SPAR-SSO, an optimal path to the sink node is chosen. This technology is interesting because to its ease in enterprise and tractability in network transportation administration to deliver integrated services. It delivers a collision-free medium and minimizes entire energy expended in attainment the terminus, dropping energy each unit or packet. Moreover, Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) is applied to optimize the results. The Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and End to End Delay is used as parameters to compare the performance of SPAR-SSO protocol. The results are compared with existing results and presented the success of the proposed method. Results show the proposed algorithm is suitable and compatibility with cyber-physical systems."

Then, based on the robust optimal allocation strategy, it can be proved that the topology of the networked cyber-physical system has a great influence on the loss function. In order to further improve security, the effects of adding redundant connections are investigated. Furthermore, by taking geographical knowledge into account, a hexagonal construction scheme is proposed for providing a geographically-feasible and economically-viable solution for building networked cyber-physical systems, where the loss function has a cubic decay."

This collaborative approach empowers communities to share unique design patterns, fostering innovation and collaboration for cutting-edge part designs. However, the convenience of sharing information over the Internet introduces security challenges, notably the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. These malicious activities could manipulate parameter values, potentially leading to inaccuracies or defects in the printed parts, thus affecting the mechanical properties negatively. In recent times, the additive manufacturing industry has witnessed numerous cyber-attacks, underscoring the importance of addressing and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in additive manufacturing processes. As we embark on this transformative journey of digital collaboration, it becomes imperative to implement robust security measures to safeguard the integrity of additive manufacturing systems and protect against cyber threats. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to fortify additive manufacturing systems against cyber attacks. This innovative framework serves as a secure platform, facilitating both clients and manufacturing industries to seamlessly submit jobs for remote printing. By implementing file integrity measures, the framework ensures the innocence of the additive manufacturing process, safeguarding against potential file modification attacks. The manipulated additive manufacturing file showing with voids have also been printed using laser powder bed fusion process to identify the affect of voids on tensile tests."
Cyber-Security Attacks on Microgrid and Its Mitigation via Adaptive Fuzzy PID Controller,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40815-024-01841-w,16 September 2024,"Rajendra Kumar Khadanga, Sidhartha Panda, Deepa Das","Cyberattacks on frequency stability problems pose a significant threat to microgrids. Furthermore, frequency fluctuations brought on by cyberattacks in any region of the microgrid impact the system, endangering the stability of the network. This problem can be fixed using a self-adaptive virtual inertia control strategy, which enhances the microgrid’s stability and damping capabilities. When using this control method, the evaluation of the microgrid’s frequency data is obtained through the usage of a phase-locked loop (PLL). However, because of its system dynamics, PLL implementation in microgrids produces more frequency oscillation. Once more, this work addresses the above problem by presenting a robust adaptive fuzzy PID controller (AFPID) for virtual inertia control. This controller will simultaneously increase the stability of the microgrid system and reduce the undesired frequency measurement impacts caused by cyberattacks. A unique modified artificial ecosystem-based optimization technique (mAEO) is put forth to fine-tune the controller parameters further. The effectiveness of the suggested solutions is examined by contrasting the simulation results with a few common strategies while considering changes in system parameters and varying rates of cyberattacks."

Using the 2016 Enterprise ICT Survey of Kenya which provides a rich source of information on the use of ICT among firms, we examine the effect of cybersecurity breach on labour productivity and show how this effect is moderated by cyber risk mitigation capabilities at the firm level. We find that cybersecurity breach reduces labour productivity at the firm level. We also find that upskilling mitigates the negative effect of cybersecurity breach on labour productivity especially for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. The results further suggest that while Information Technology Policy and Information Technology Security capabilities can enable firms to improve labour productivity, these measures are not sufficient to offset the adverse effect of cybersecurity breach on labour productivity. Together the results imply that upskilling is an effective cyber risk mitigation measure against cybersecurity breaches at the firm level and therefore should be an integral part of the overarching IT governance strategy of firms."

The latter has not yet received much attention. Now that governments and health services are increasingly requiring their citizens/patients to use online services, the need for accessible security and privacy has become far more pressing. The reality is that, for many, security measures are often exasperatingly inaccessible. Regardless of the outcome of the debate about the social acceptability of compelling people to access public services online, we still need to design accessibility into these systems, or risk excluding and marginalising swathes of the population who cannot use these systems in the same way as abled users. These users are particularly vulnerable to attack and online deception not only because security and privacy controls are inaccessible but also because they often struggle with depleted resources and capabilities together with less social, economic and political resilience. This conceptual paper contemplates the accessible dimension of human-centred security and its impact on the inclusivity of security technologies. We scope the range of vulnerabilities that can result from a lack of accessibility in security solutions and contemplate the nuances and complex challenges inherent in making security accessible. We conclude by suggesting a number of avenues for future work in this space."

Under the attack circumstance, the output and state information of CPSs is unavailable for the feedback design, and the classical coordinate conversion of the iterative process is incompetent in relation to the tracking task. To solve this, a new coordinate conversion is proposed by considering the attack gains and the reference signal simultaneously. By employing the transformed variables, a modified fractional-order command-filtered signal is incorporated to overcome the complexity explosion issue, and the Nussbaum function is used to tackle the varying attack gains. By systematically constructing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism is presented in detail, with which the communication resources are greatly saved, and the finite-time tracking of CPSs under cyber attacks is guaranteed. Finally, an example demonstrates the effectiveness."

Safe and secure system architectures for cyber-physical systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00287-023-01533-z,03 April 2023,Frank J. Furrer,"Cyber-physical systems are at the core of our current civilization. Countless examples dominate our daily life and work, such as driverless cars that will soon master our roads, implanted medical devices that will improve many lives, and industrial control systems that control production and infrastructure. Because cyber-physical systems manipulate the real world, they constitute a danger for many applications. Therefore, theirsafetyandsecurityare essential properties of these indispensable systems. The long history of systems engineering has demonstrated that the system quality properties—such as safety and security—strongly depend on the underlyingsystem architecture. Satisfactory system quality properties can only be ensured if the fundamental system architecture is sound! The development of dependable cyber-physical architectures in recent years suggests thattwoharmonical architectures are required: adesign-time architectureand arun-time architecture. The design-time architecture defines and specifies all parts and relationships, assuring the required system quality properties. However, in today’s complex systems, ensuring all quality properties in all operating conditions during design time will never be possible. Therefore, an additional line of defense against safety accidents and security incidents is indispensable: This must be provided by the run-time architecture. The run-time architecture primarily consists of aprotective shellthat monitors the run-time system during operation. It detects anomalies in system behavior, interface functioning, or data—often using artificial intelligence algorithms—and takes autonomous mitigation measures, thus attempting to prevent imminent safety accidents or security incidents before they occur. This paper’s core is theprotective shellas a run-time protection mechanism for cyber-physical systems. The paper has the form of an introductorytutorialand includes focused references."
Cyber threat assessment and management for securing healthcare ecosystems using natural language processing,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00769-w,27 October 2023,"Stefano Silvestri, Shareful Islam, Dmitry Amelin, Gabriele Weiler, Spyridon Papastergiou, Mario Ciampi","The healthcare sectors have constantly faced significant challenge due to the rapid rise of cyber threats. These threats can pose any potential risk within the system context and disrupt the critical healthcare service delivery. It is therefore necessary for the healthcare organisations to understand and tackle the threats to ensure overall security and resilience. However, threats are continuously evolved and there is large amount of unstructured security-related textual information is available. This makes the threat assessment and management task very challenging. There are a number of existing works that consider Machine Learning models for detection and prediction of cyber attack but they lack of focus on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the threat information from unstructured security-related text. To this end, this work proposes a novel method to assess and manage threats by adopting natural language processing. The proposed method has been tailored for the healthcare ecosystem and allows to identify and assess the possible threats within healthcare information infrastructure so that appropriate control and mitigation actions can be taken into consideration to tackle the threat. In detail, NLP techniques are used to extract the useful threat information related to specific assets of the healthcare ecosystems from the largely available security-related information on Internet (e.g. cyber security news), to evaluate the level of the identified threats and to select the required mitigation actions. We have performed experiments on real healthcare ecosystems in Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering, considering in particular three different healthcare scenarios, namely implantable medical devices, wearables, and biobank, with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of our approach, which is able to provide a realistic manner to identify and assess the threats, evaluate the threat level and suggest the required mitigation actions."
Secure communication based on intelligent adaptive interlayer exponential synchronous for DANNs under cyber attacks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-024-09988-9,19 July 2024,"Fei Tan, Lili Zhou, Fujin Jia, Chunlai Li","In recent years, cyber security has become a increasingly prominent, with the core issue being the design of secure communication. In this paper, a secure communication framework based on secure interlayer exponential synchronous of duplex artificial neural networks (DANNs) under cyber attacks is developed. To resist random uncertainties and cyber attacks which is conceled in transmission of the signals, based on the Lyapunov’s second method, an intelligent adaptive controller is designed. Based upon Lyapunov stable theory, the criteria for the interlayer synchronous are got. Finally, a secure communication framework based on the secure synchronous policy is derived.Through simulation experiments, exponential synchronous for DANNs and signal security communication have been achieved. Thus, the effectiveness of the theoretical framework is validated. The researches provide references in the design of secure communication schemes in engineering."
An adaptive predefined time sliding mode control for uncertain nonlinear cyber-physical servo system under cyber attacks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-57775-8,28 March 2024,"Saleem Riaz, Bingqiang Li, Rong Qi, Chenda Zhang","Malicious attacks are often inevitable in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Accuracy in Cyber physical system for position tracking of servos is the major concern now a days. In high precision industrial automation, it is very hard to achieve accuracy in tracking especially under malicious cyber-attacks, control saturations, parametric perturbations and external disturbances. In this paper, we have designed a novel predefined time (PDT) convergence sliding mode adaptive controller (PTCSMAC) for such kind of cyber physical control system. Main key feature of our control is to cope these challenges that are posed by CPS systems such as parameter perturbation, control saturation, and cyber-attacks and the whole system then upgrade to a third-order system to facilitate adaptive control law. Then, we present an adaptive controller based on the novel PDT convergent sliding mode surface (SMS) combined with a modified weight updated Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which is used to approximate the uncertain part of the system. Another significant advantage of our proposed control approach is that it does not require detailed model information, guaranteeing robust performance even when the system model is uncertain. Additionally, our proposed PTCSMAC controller is nonsingular regardless of initial conditions, and is capable of eradicating the possibility of singularity problems, which are frequently a concern in numerous CPS control systems. Finally, we have verified our designed PTCSMAC control law through rigorous simulations on CPS seeker servo positioning system and compared the robustness and performance of different existing techniques."
A survey on cyber threat intelligence sharing based on Blockchain,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43674-023-00057-z,23 May 2023,"Ahmed El-Kosairy, Nashwa Abdelbaki, Heba Aslan","In recent years, cyber security attacks have increased massively. This introduces the need to defend against such attacks. Cyber security threat intelligence has recently been introduced to secure systems against security attacks. Cyber security threat intelligence (CTI) should be fast, trustful, and protect the sender's identity to stop these attacks at the right time. Threat intelligence sharing is vitally important since it is considered an effective way to improve threat understanding. This leads to protecting the assets and preventing the attack vectors. However, there is a paradox between the privacy safeguard needs of threat intelligence sharing; the need to produce complete proper threat intelligence feeds to be shared with the community, and other challenges and needs that are not covered in the traditional CTI. This paper aims to study how Blockchain technology can be incorporated with the CTI to solve the current issues and challenges in the traditional CTI. We collected the latest contributions that use Blockchain to overcome the conventional CTI problems and compared them to raise the reader’s awareness about the different methods used. Also, we mentioned the uncovered areas for each paper to offer a wide range of details and information about different areas that need to be investigated. Furthermore, the prospect challenges of integrating the Blockchain and CTI are discussed."
An integrated approach of designing functionality with security for distributed cyber-physical systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-022-04481-9,09 April 2022,"Dipty Tripathi, Amit Biswas, Anil Kumar Tripathi, Lalit Kumar Singh, Amrita Chaturvedi","In this work, we propose a multi-tier architectural model to separate functionality and security concerns for distributed cyber-physical systems. On the line of distributed computing, such systems require the identification of leaders for distribution of work, aggregation of results, etc. Further, we propose a fault-tolerant leader election algorithm that can independently elect the functionality and security leaders. The proposed election algorithm identifies a list of potential leader capable nodes to reduce the leader election overhead. It keeps identifying the highest potential node as the leader, whenever needed, including the situation when one has failed. We also explain the proposed architecture and its management method through a case study. Further, we perform several experiments to evaluate the system performance. The experimental results show that the proposed architectural model improves the system performance in terms of latency, average response time, and the number of real-time tasks completed within the deadline."
CyberDefender: an integrated intelligent defense framework for digital-twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-024-04320-x,20 March 2024,"S. Krishnaveni, Thomas M. Chen, Mithileysh Sathiyanarayanan, B. Amutha","The rise of digital twin-based operational improvements poses a challenge to protecting industrial cyber-physical systems. It is crucial to safeguard digital twins while disclosing internals, which can create an increased attack surface. However, leveraging digital twins to simulate attacks on physical infrastructure becomes essential for enhancing ICPS cybersecurity resilience. This paper introduces an integrated intelligent defense framework called CyberDefender to study various attacks on digital twin-based ICPS from a four-layer perspective (i.e., digital twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems infrastructure layer, honeynet and software-defined industrial network layer, intelligent security platform layer, and smart industrial application layer). To demonstrate its feasibility, we implemented a proof-of-concept (PoC) solution using open-source tools, including AWS for cloud infrastructure, T-Pot for Honeynet, Mininet for SDN support, ELK tools for data management, and Docker for containerization. This framework utilizes an integrated intelligent approach to enhance intrusion detection and classification capabilities for digital twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems (DT-ICPS). The proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) combines two strategies to improve security. First, we present an innovative approach to identifying essential features using explainable AI and ensemble-based filter feature selection (XAI-EFFS). By using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we analyze the impact of different variables on predictive outcomes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid GRU-LSTM deep-learning model for detecting and classifying intrusions. We optimize the hyperparameters of the GRU-LSTM model by using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates excellent performance, outperforming conventional state-of-the-art techniques with an accuracy rate of 98.96%, which is a remarkable improvement. Additionally, it effectively detects zero-day attacks, contributing to digital twin-based ICPS cybersecurity resilience."
