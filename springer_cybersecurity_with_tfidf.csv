Perceptions and dilemmas around cyber-security in a Spanish research center after a cyber-attack,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00847-7,04 April 2024,"Joaquín Navajas-Adán, Eulàlia Badia-Gelabert, Laura Jiménez-Saurina, Mª Jesús Marijuán-Martín, Rafael Mayo-García","Information and Communication Technologies and Internet networks are present in all aspects of social reality and are essential elements in research, development and innovation centers (R&D&I). Cyber-security is crucial for the progress of the research activities developed in these centers, especially given the exponential growth of cyber-attacks and incidents. The present study aims to assess from a socio-technical approach, how a serious cyber-attack on a Spanish research center has affected staff’s perceptions of information and communication systems (ICT) security. This study employed a mixed-methods research strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of ICT security perceptions among employees. First a quantitative scale was administered to 1,321 employees 3 years before the cyber-attack and 4 months afterward, to measure ICT security perceptions. Then, qualitative techniques (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and micro-ethnography) were applied to gain a deeper understanding of the arguments underpinning cyber-security at the center after the attack. The results show that the event had an impact on employees’ perceptions, increasing the perceived importance of ICT security, with positive behavioral changes noted, but with doubts about their sustainability over time. Also, the need for cyber-security governance was critically contrasted with organizational reality. Finally, the compatibility of science and cyber-security was a central dilemma, which seems to confront antagonistic poles (research and security ICT) and justify the non-compliance with security protocols by part of the staff.",information communication technology internet network present aspect social reality essential element research development innovation center rdi cybersecurity crucial progress research activity developed center especially give exponential growth cyberattacks incident present study aim ass sociotechnical approach serious cyberattack spanish research center affected staff perception information communication system ict security study employ mixedmethods research strategy combine quantitative qualitative method provide comprehensive nuanced understand ict security perception among employee first quantitative scale administer employee year cyberattack month afterward measure ict security perception qualitative technique semistructured interview focus group microethnography apply gain deeper understand argument underpin cybersecurity center attack result show event impact employee perception increase perceive importance ict security positive behavioral change note doubt sustainability time also need cybersecurity governance critically contrast organizational reality finally compatibility science cybersecurity central dilemma seem confront antagonistic pole research security ict justify noncompliance security protocol part staff,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11798233321130484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10002863863468266,0.0,0.0,0.08586422452262571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24417547794990965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427638134567348,0.0,0.43602194369197494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427638134567348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13149460075372515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427638134567348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11067467445769516,0.0,0.19735922651258025,0.0,0.0,0.11999225906569372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12656685694026384,0.10002863863468266,0.0,0.12656685694026384,0.09867961325629013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2248048856564138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09362529778908761,0.0,0.4933980662814506,0.0948410718109368,0.0,0.0,0.3327837806715316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16309714089707286,0.0,0.12896910635400483,0.17591940886377358,0.0,0.0,0.11067467445769516,0.10141566968550692,0.0,0.13697094462927836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Maritime decision-makers and cyber security: deck officers’ perception of cyber risks towards IT and OT systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00810-y,02 February 2024,"Marie Haugli-Sandvik, Mass Soldal Lund, Frøy Birte Bjørneseth","Through a quantitative study of deck officers’ cyber risk perceptions towards information (IT) and operational (OT) systems, this paper contributes to substantiate the importance of considering human behaviour within maritime cyber security. Using survey data from 293 deck officers working on offshore vessels, statistical analyses were conducted to measure and predict the participants cyber risk perceptions towards IT and OT systems. Performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a significant discrepancy in the levels of cyber risk perception between the system categories. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to develop statistical models, considering multiple independent variables, including perceived benefit, cyber security training, experience with cyber-attacks, and trust towards various stakeholders. Key findings revealed distinct results for IT and OT systems, and the regression models varied in both predictive power and significance of the independent variables. Perceived benefit positively predicts deck officers cyber risk perception for both IT and OT systems, while trust, which included measures of social trust and confidence, was not found to be significant. Cyber security training and experience with cyber-attacks only influence deck officers’ perception of cyber risks related to operational technology. Practical implications of this work provide actionable recommendations for the maritime industry, including tailored risk communication tools, training programs, reporting systems, and holistic policies.",quantitative study deck officer cyber risk perception towards information operational ot system paper contributes substantiate importance consider human behaviour within maritime cyber security use survey data deck officer work offshore vessel statistical analysis conduct measure predict participant cyber risk perception towards ot system perform wilcoxon signedrank test reveal significant discrepancy level cyber risk perception system category hierarchical regression analysis conduct develop statistical model consider multiple independent variable include perceive benefit cyber security training experience cyberattacks trust towards various stakeholder key finding reveal distinct result ot system regression model varied predictive power significance independent variable perceive benefit positively predicts deck officer cyber risk perception ot system trust include measure social trust confidence found significant cyber security training experience cyberattacks influence deck officer perception cyber risk related operational technology practical implication work provide actionable recommendation maritime industry include tailor risk communication tool training program reporting system holistic policy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.185104083258557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09577255502988996,0.0,0.21957867814399448,0.0,0.0,0.4312308020170751,0.1949789007688273,0.0,0.0,0.06578007342198394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25653027863661465,0.0,0.10744778666672351,0.07740989201917359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11780915741409212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19857245900439305,0.0,0.14143496435423816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716054244039279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07344499996461291,0.0,0.0,0.07439872214334331,0.49810422518821607,0.0,0.13052724710528568,0.0,0.18825748320046184,0.0,0.12794265855793244,0.0,0.0,0.06900058682259538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07955621004530891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36270212942257646,0.05685366382313566,0.0,0.10117069035063787,0.0,0.185104083258557

A modular cyber security training programme for the maritime domain,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00799-4,03 January 2024,"Aybars Oruc, Nabin Chowdhury, Vasileios Gkioulos","The global maritime industry is continuing the rapid digitization of systems and dependency on advancing technology, in a trend akin to other industrial domains. One of the main issues that this integration has brought is an increased vulnerability to a growing number of cyber threats. While several security measures are being implemented to prevent or respond to cyber attacks, the human element is still one of the main weaknesses. Many of today’s cyber attacks take advantage of human personnel’s lack of awareness, which makes cyber security awareness and training activities of critical importance. Unfortunately, current research is still limited in its offerings for cyber security training specific to maritime personnel. Moreover, such training programmes for the professionals should be developed role-based in accordance with the suggestions of many credited maritime organizations. For this reason, we developed a modular cyber security training programme for the maritime domain called Maritime Cyber Security (MarCy) by implementing Critical Events Model (CEM). Then, we evaluated the MarCy programme by utilizing the Delphi technique with the participation of 19 experts from academia and industry. In this study, we offer cyber security training for seafarers and office employees in shipping companies. We proposed eleven elective modules to improve the knowledge, skills, and attitude of learners against cyber risks. The MarCy programme can be implemented by universities, shipping companies, training institutes, and governmental organizations for maritime cyber security training purposes.",global maritime industry continue rapid digitization system dependency advance technology trend akin industrial domain one main issue integration brought increase vulnerability grow number cyber threat several security measure implement prevent respond cyber attack human element still one main weakness many today cyber attack take advantage human personnel lack awareness make cyber security awareness training activity critical importance unfortunately current research still limited offering cyber security training specific maritime personnel moreover training programme professional developed rolebased accordance suggestion many credit maritime organization reason developed modular cyber security training programme maritime domain call maritime cyber security marcy implement critical event model cem evaluate marcy programme utilize delphi technique participation expert academia industry study offer cyber security training seafarer office employee shipping company propose eleven elective module improve knowledge skill attitude learner cyber risk marcy programme implement university shipping company training institute governmental organization maritime cyber security training purpose,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10789854040181018,0.18871800845912653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4317417886330182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.175871094187392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26380664128108805,0.07808397634851699,0.0,0.0695379006787869,0.1721201709457232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706234731996306,0.09683517681046486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174852963444282,0.0,0.07952310291639945,0.0,0.0566410230437371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.175871094187392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058080149611619565,0.0,0.0,0.06200129505020555,0.0,0.06649259378891612,0.0,0.24393957516880724,0.0,0.0,0.1093785003984759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05526587921302637,0.0,0.0,0.0695379006787869,0.06372038409346413,0.060372727336772354,0.0,0.0,0.6778462376732541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08429185322245385,0.0

The usage and implementation of information systems has offered new opportunities while also introducing new types of risk. Cyber security is one of the most significant challenges that maritime information systems have faced. These most recent changes and technological developments necessitate the identification of new competencies and skillsets in order for seafarers to take steps to protect themselves and the assets they are responsible for against the consequences of cyber-attacks. The present study is aimed at determining the future skill requirements for maritime cyber security to fulfill the inconsistencies between current and actual marine transportation demands. In the paper, the skill requirements for cyber security are comprehensively analyzed in terms of information and operational technology implementations and their regulatory requirements. The AHP technique is then used to establish the priorities of three categories as well as the skills within each category. Considering the strong relations between seafarer training and maritime safety, determining future skill requirements will improve overall maritime safety and security. Therefore, the present study contributes to a great extent, not just to maritime safety literature but also to the maritime industry.",maritime transportation many onboard ship operation digitalize usage implementation information system offer new opportunity also introduce new type risk cyber security one significant challenge maritime information system face recent change technological development necessitate identification new competency skillsets order seafarer take step protect asset responsible consequence cyberattacks present study aim determine future skill requirement maritime cyber security fulfill inconsistency current actual marine transportation demand paper skill requirement cyber security comprehensively analyze term information operational technology implementation regulatory requirement ahp technique use establish priority three category well skill within category consider strong relation seafarer training maritime safety determine future skill requirement improve overall maritime safety security therefore present study contributes great extent maritime safety literature also maritime industry,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11546645424418034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100055505641895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20174875721231814,0.1216262868321335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1216262868321335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1216262868321335,0.0,0.0,0.13405014869890122,0.28972604809782826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3407296454087122,0.0,0.08933378794267133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.220011101128379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10357115073503612,0.0,0.21712495500093457,0.0,0.11743352003600815,0.6814868547859919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17216806806025967,0.0,0.0,0.10831462547338852,0.09925306157839614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15083380151673909,0.07092972620467174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Cyber range design framework for cyber security education and training,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00680-4,18 March 2023,"M. N. Katsantonis, A. Manikas, I. Mavridis, D. Gritzalis","The need for effective training of cyber security personnel working in critical infrastructures and in the corporate has brought attention to the evolution of Cyber Ranges (CRs) as learning and training tools. Although CRs have been organized for many years, there is a lack of standards and common methodologies that facilitate their development and optimize their effectiveness. Aiming at strengthening cyber security education and research that utilize well designed CRs, we first analyze the CRs domain to identify key characteristics, strengths and fundamental weaknesses, and based on these outcomes we propose the Cyber Range Design Framework (CRDF), which includes the CR Architecture and the CR Life-Cycle. The CR Architecture presents the main components of CRDF compliant CRs, whereas the CR Life-Cycle presents the development phases of such approaches and the activities these phases embrace. CRDF builds on the Conceptual Framework for eLearning and Training (COFELET) and on the Exercise Life-Cycle.

Cyber-Security awareness and its contribution towards sustainable human development: insights from the Zimbabwean context,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-024-00120-6,29 April 2024,"Colletor Tendeukai Chipfumbu, Theo Tsokota, Tendayi Marovah","Focusing on citizens’ awareness of cyber-security, this paper contributes to debates on ICTs and their contribution towards human development. The paper philosophically argues for the importance of cyber-security and cybercrime awareness in fostering sustainable human development through the responsible and meaningful use of ICT. Using the overarching values of the human development framework (empowerment, participation and sustainability), the paper assesses government ICT policy documents and subsequent initiatives such as the establishment of community information centres and integration of ICT in the education sector. This was done to establish the extent to which citizens have been provided with prerequisite knowledge and skills to deal with cyber-crime. It emerged from the study that regardless of the effort by the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) to enforce a law which encourage a cyber-security culture, awareness about cyber-security remains far below what can be expected in a cyber-world. As a result, if citizens’ lack cyber knowledge their freedom to be and do what they reasonably value on the Internet is continually threatened. The paper, thus, suggests the introduction of rigorous citizens’ awareness campaigns on cyber-crime and security to enable them to deal with unfounded fears and experiences that potentially limit their ability to deliberate, transact or act to be and freely do what they reasonably value.",focus citizen awareness cybersecurity paper contributes debate icts contribution towards human development paper philosophically argues importance cybersecurity cybercrime awareness foster sustainable human development responsible meaningful use ict use overarch value human development framework empowerment participation sustainability paper ass government ict policy document subsequent initiative establishment community information centre integration ict education sector do establish extent citizen provide prerequisite knowledge skill deal cybercrime emerge study regardless effort government zimbabwe goz enforce law encourage cybersecurity culture awareness cybersecurity remains far expect cyberworld result citizen lack cyber knowledge freedom reasonably value internet continually threaten paper thus suggests introduction rigorous citizen awareness campaign cybercrime security enable deal unfounded fear experience potentially limit ability deliberate transact act freely reasonably value,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5838152941494251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06678150680621883,0.0,0.0,0.42375398587522245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3623391852675754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12779485527413292,0.11661614464335471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590315360714724,0.0,0.0,0.11661614464335471,0.0,0.0,0.299567898661126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.354847983201627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909910468747143,0.0,0.0,0.09217261375485758,0.0,0.0,0.05390342372072943,0.0,0.0,0.16918587130382326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08548486122925496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408720646040632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As such, the objective of this study is to identify the knowledge gaps in cyber security graduates who join the cyber security workforce. We designed and performed an opinion survey by using the Cyber Security Knowledge Areas (KAs) specified in the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) that comprises 19 KAs. Our data was gathered from practitioners who work in cyber security organizations. The knowledge gap was measured and evaluated by acknowledging the assumption for employing sequent data as nominal data and improved it by deploying chi-squared test. Analyses demonstrate that there is a gap that can be utilized to enhance the quality of education. According to acquired final results, three key KAs with the highest knowledge gap are Web and Mobile Security, Security Operations and Incident Management. Also, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Software Lifecycles, and Vulnerabilities are the knowledge areas with largest difference in perception of importance between less and more experienced personnel. We discuss several suggestions to improve the cyber security curriculum in order to minimize the knowledge gaps. There is an expanding demand for executive cyber security personnel in industry. High-quality university education is required to improve the qualification of upcoming workforce. The capability and capacity of the national cyber security workforce is crucial for nations and security organizations. A wide range of skills, namely technical skills, implementation skills, management skills, and soft skills are required in new cyber security graduates. The use of each CyBOK KA in the industry was measured in response to the extent of learning in university environments.

However, this increased reliance on technology and connectivity also introduces new vulnerabilities, making SG communication networks susceptible to large-scale attacks. While previous surveys have mainly provided high-level overviews of SG architecture, our analysis goes further by presenting a comprehensive architectural diagram encompassing key SG components and communication links. This holistic view enhances understanding of potential cyber threats and enables systematic cyber risk assessment for SGs. Additionally, we propose a taxonomy of various cyberattack types based on their targets and methods, offering detailed insights into vulnerabilities. Unlike other reviews focused narrowly on protection and detection, our proposed categorization covers all five functions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework. This delivers a broad perspective to help organizations implement balanced and robust security. Consequently, we have identified critical research gaps, especially regarding response and recovery mechanisms. This underscores the need for further investigation to bolster SG cybersecurity.

To date, the dominant themes in interventions have been around personal deterrence (i.e. the threat of legal action) and have not considered other factors that may influence an individual’s decision to consume infringing content. In this paper, we consider psychological factors, including perceptions around risk-taking, security behaviours, problematic internet use and personality traits, to gain a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing engagement with IPTV and the potential implications for cyber security. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with 283 participants living in the UK (age range 18–74, male 104), and an integrated structural equation model was constructed. Our findings showed a positive relationship between security behaviours and the perceived risk of viewing IPTV and a negative relationship between the dark personality triad and the perceived risk of viewing IPTV. They suggest that security behaviours fully mediate the relationship between problematic internet use and IPTV risk-taking, indicating a potential new path for anti-piracy interventions with greater efficacy.",spur rapid modernisation sector advent internet protocol television iptv audiovisual av piracy epidemic level intervention limited effect date dominant theme intervention around personal deterrence ie threat legal action consider factor may influence individual decision consume infringe content paper consider psychological factor include perception around risktaking security behaviour problematic internet use personality trait gain comprehensive understand factor influence engagement iptv potential implication cyber security purpose survey conduct participant living uk age range male integrate structural equation model construct finding show positive relationship security behaviour perceive risk view iptv negative relationship dark personality triad perceive risk view iptv suggest security behaviour fully mediate relationship problematic internet use iptv risktaking indicate potential new path antipiracy intervention great efficacy,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21223667168182037,0.0,0.0,0.10420295690864784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16530181947733333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5458882710022591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22773999437969028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13670583295111888,0.0,0.0,0.17598639539899513,0.0,0.1384223375266685,0.0,0.0,0.4154203097400762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32096614540225044,0.0,0.3364342260499397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19940553057478014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14571248071792783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2198106388968523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As a response, a host of cyber-security approaches exists. While useful, these approaches exhibit shortcomings such as an inclination to be fragmented, not accounting for up-to-date organizational data, focusing on singular vulnerabilities only, and being reactive, i.e., focusing on patching up vulnerabilities in current systems. The paper presents and evaluates a modeling method aiming to address those shortcomings and to support security by design with a focus on the electricity sector. The proposed modeling method encompasses a multi-level reference model reconstructing and integrating existing initiatives and supporting top-down and bottom-up analyses.

However, the effectiveness of these exercises is limited by the exercise planners’ ability to replicate real-world scenarios in a timely manner that is, most importantly, tailored to the training audience and sector impacted. To address this issue, we propose the integration of AI-driven sectorial threat intelligence and forecasting to identify emerging and relevant threats and anticipate their impact in different industries. By incorporating such automated analysis and forecasting into the design of cyber security exercises, organisations can simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and assess their ability to respond to emerging threats. Fundamentally, our approach enhances the effectiveness of cyber security exercises by tailoring the scenarios to reflect the threats that are more relevant and imminent to the sector of the targeted organisation, thereby enhancing its preparedness for cyber attacks. To assess the efficacy of our forecasting methodology, we conducted a survey with domain experts and report their feedback and evaluation of the proposed methodology.",escalate complexity impact cyber threat require organisation rehearse response cyberattacks routinely conduct cyber security exercise however effectiveness exercise limited exercise planner ability replicate realworld scenario timely manner importantly tailor training audience sector impact address issue propose integration aidriven sectorial threat intelligence forecasting identify emerge relevant threat anticipate impact different industry incorporate automate analysis forecasting design cyber security exercise organisation simulate realworld scenario accurately ass ability respond emerge threat fundamentally approach enhances effectiveness cyber security exercise tailor scenario reflect threat relevant imminent sector target organisation thereby enhance preparedness cyber attack ass efficacy forecasting methodology conduct survey domain expert report feedback evaluation propose methodology,0.0,0.12699221029155447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12699221029155447,0.0,0.10766745805851183,0.0,0.0,0.0924213597095885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3012875910625234,0.0,0.0,0.36981188995068065,0.13376691174480834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13623230254069083,0.0,0.0,0.13376691174480834,0.0,0.1506437955312617,0.1444017251438101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314111308017622,0.401300735234425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474309121607327,0.0,0.0,0.14153636003463116,0.0,0.0,0.1209862041917675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989960709107851,0.0,0.1444017251438101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17909862733842052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5171274355577042,0.0,0.0,0.16588989388018505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Through time-series modeling of security data, such as event logs, alerts, or incidents, analysts take a step towards these goals. On the one hand, extrapolating time-series to predict future occurrences of attacks and vulnerabilities is able to support decision-making and preparation against threats. On the other hand, detection of model deviations as anomalies can point to suspicious outliers and thereby disclose cyber attacks. However, since the set of available techniques for time-series analysis is just as diverse as the research domains in the area of cyber security analytics, it can be difficult for analysts to understand which approaches fit the properties of security data at hand. This paper therefore conducts a broad literature review in research domains that leverage time-series analysis for cyber security analytics, with focus on available techniques, data sets, and challenges imposed by applications or feature properties. The results of our study indicate that relevant approaches range from detective systems ingesting short-term and low-level events to models that produce long-term forecasts of high-level attack cases.",understand current threat landscape well timely detection imminent attack primary objective cyber security timeseries model security data event log alert incident analyst take step towards goal one hand extrapolate timeseries predict future occurrence attack vulnerability able support decisionmaking preparation threat hand detection model deviation anomaly point suspicious outlier thereby disclose cyber attack however since set available technique timeseries analysis diverse research domain area cyber security analytics difficult analyst understand approach fit property security data hand paper therefore conduct broad literature review research domain leverage timeseries analysis cyber security analytics focus available technique data set challenge impose application feature property result study indicate relevant approach range detective system ingest shortterm lowlevel event model produce longterm forecast highlevel attack case,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470262027195798,0.12149149149025869,0.2094355493112682,0.0,0.0,0.3595574482375686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11767163723795597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14651672211987324,0.0,0.0,0.2877443480520101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633556450942851,0.0,0.2512344967755073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2930334442397465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14984332433607353,0.1376587961018875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2831229454355496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555929708972825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066110195064557,0.09928702541147004,0.0,0.0,0.29031999759490645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208307373965215,0.0,0.15721937781862022,0.23172574930812168,0.0,0.20118403551627828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14044566098399563,0.0
AI hype as a cyber security risk: the moral responsibility of implementing generative AI in business,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00443-4,23 February 2024,"Declan Humphreys, Abigail Koay, Dennis Desmond, Erica Mealy","This paper examines the ethical obligations companies have when implementing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We point to the potential cyber security risks companies are exposed to when rushing to adopt generative AI solutions or buying into “AI hype”. While the benefits of implementing generative AI solutions for business have been widely touted, the inherent risks associated have been less well publicised. There are growing concerns that the race to integrate generative AI is not being accompanied by adequate safety measures. The rush to buy into the hype of generative AI and not fall behind the competition is potentially exposing companies to broad and possibly catastrophic cyber-attacks or breaches. In this paper, we outline significant cyber security threats generative AI models pose, including potential ‘backdoors’ in AI models that could compromise user data or the risk of ‘poisoned’ AI models producing false results. In light of these the cyber security concerns, we discuss the moral obligations of implementing generative AI into business by considering the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We identify two examples of ethical concern,overrelianceandover-trustin generative AI, both of which can negatively influence business decisions, leaving companies vulnerable to cyber security threats. This paper concludes by recommending a set of checklists for ethical implementation of generative AI in business environment to minimise cyber security risk based on the discussed moral responsibilities and ethical concern.",paper examines ethical obligation company implement generative artificial intelligence ai point potential cyber security risk company expose rush adopt generative ai solution buying ai hype benefit implement generative ai solution business widely tout inherent risk associate less well publicise grow concern race integrate generative ai accompany adequate safety measure rush buy hype generative ai fall behind competition potentially expose company broad possibly catastrophic cyberattacks breach paper outline significant cyber security threat generative ai model pose include potential backdoor ai model could compromise user data risk poison ai model produce false result light cyber security concern discus moral obligation implement generative ai business consider ethical principle beneficence nonmaleficence autonomy justice explicability identify two example ethical concernoverrelianceandovertrustin generative ai negatively influence business decision leave company vulnerable cyber security threat paper concludes recommend set checklist ethical implementation generative ai business environment minimise cyber security risk base discuss moral responsibility ethical concern,0.0,0.0,0.8549248416047267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04834466952740324,0.26240394558271046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15007940913436682,0.05428613741723443,0.0,0.0,0.03662905156425524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057439184250834434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0533300994379539,0.0,0.18340566464295086,0.0,0.047615538238023065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057439184250834434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05528665796291158,0.0,0.11813521176282102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11961854006818243,0.0,0.0,0.1196626976389231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041428269807805715,0.18490995220542475,0.0,0.12113823675468709,0.0,0.05241475648157354,0.0,0.0,0.1250465434686343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394557566661358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06400712302898832,0.0,0.0,0.0

Suresh Kumar, Osamah Ibrahim Khalaf, Radha Raman Chandan, Qusay Bsoul, Shashi Kant Gupta, Firas Zawaideh, Deema Mohammed Alsekait, Diaa Salama AbdElminaam","Robust verification protocols are crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of sensitive information due to the increasing complexity of cyber-attacks. This paper introduces a novel 5G Secure Handover Protocol aimed at addressing security and effectiveness issues encountered in existing systems. The proposed protocol is robust against various attacks, including de-synchronization, replay, man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of services (DoS), and jamming, ensures perfect forward key secrecy, safeguarding communication confidentiality. The proposed protocol utilizes a combination of spiking neural network and fuzzy logic (SNN-FL) techniques that must choose the goal cell as carefully as possible before initiating the transfer process. By combining fuzzy logic and spiking neural networks to reduce handover latency and thwart several types of cyberattacks, the proposed 5G Secure Handover Protocol improves security. Extensive simulations show its efficacy and emphasize its potential for safe communication in large-scale cybersecurity applications. The paper presents a novel secure authentication protocol that significantly reduces handover delays and improves efficiency. Simulations show its resilience against common security threats, protecting sensitive information and maintaining secure communication channels. The protocol, with low communication expenses, complex spatial, and latency for changeover verification, is ideal for large-scale cybersecurity applications, contributing to the development of secure digital authentication mechanisms.",robust verification protocol crucial maintain security reliability sensitive information due increase complexity cyberattacks paper introduces novel g secure handover protocol aim address security effectiveness issue encounter exist system propose protocol robust various attack include desynchronization replay maninthemiddle mitm denial service do jamming ensures perfect forward key secrecy safeguard communication confidentiality propose protocol utilizes combination spike neural network fuzzy logic snnfl technique must choose goal cell carefully possible initiate transfer process combine fuzzy logic spike neural network reduce handover latency thwart several type cyberattacks propose g secure handover protocol improves security extensive simulation show efficacy emphasize potential safe communication largescale cybersecurity application paper present novel secure authentication protocol significantly reduces handover delay improves efficiency simulation show resilience common security threat protect sensitive information maintain secure communication channel protocol low communication expense complex spatial latency changeover verification ideal largescale cybersecurity application contribute development secure digital authentication mechanism,0.0,0.10402503829972248,0.0,0.10402503829972248,0.0,0.0,0.20464480150247386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570649775627815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4305791003488746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2191490026914619,0.0,0.1922203017923157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10957450134573095,0.0,0.12076729941838948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12339911687321212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09611015089615785,0.0975818746409391,0.0,0.17401165528745105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910524823445532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17401165528745105,0.0,0.0,0.1609636456410724,0.0,0.0,0.12076729941838948,0.09910524823445532,0.0,0.1137120775864673,0.24450996463243765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5685603879323365,0.19561033468676142,0.12339911687321212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975818746409391,0.0,0.08472047406092749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137120775864673,0.0,0.0
DL-SkLSTM approach for cyber security threats detection in 5G enabled IIoT,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-023-01651-7,18 December 2023,"Anjali Rajak, Rakesh Tripathi","The advancement of 5G technology has enabled the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) to integrate artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge computing in real-time, leading to an improvement in industrial procedures in terms of efficiency. Despite the benefits of 5G technology for the IIoT, it also introduces new security risks and complexity to the control systems used in these ecosystems. Recent cyber-attacks are increasingly targeting vulnerable IoT devices, highlighting the need for enhanced security and privacy measures.

The LeWiS Method: Target Variable Estimation Using Cyber Security Intelligence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-024-02744-1,18 April 2024,"Leigh Chase, Alaa Mohasseb, Benjamin Aziz","Information technology plays an increasingly important role in the provision of essential services. For these systems and networks to be reliable and trustworthy, we must defend them from those who would seek to compromise their confidentiality, integrity and availability. Security intelligence tells us about the tactics, techniques and procedures used by threat actors for these very purposes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for learning malicious behaviours and then estimating how likely it is that a system has been compromised. One of the difficulties encountered when applying machine learning to cyber security, is the lack of ground truth on which to train supervised techniques. This is often compounded by the volume, variety and velocity of data which is far greater than can be processed using only human analyses. The technique known as LeWiS, created and described by the authors, includes data preparation and processing phases that learn and later predict the presence of threat actors using a model of their behaviours. The method addresses the problems of scale and veracity, by learning indicators of attack via feature extraction from security intelligence that has been obtained through empirical methods. This approach shows promising classification performance for detecting learned malicious behaviours, within synthesised systems’ event data.",information technology play increasingly important role provision essential service system network reliable trustworthy must defend would seek compromise confidentiality integrity availability security intelligence tell u tactic technique procedure use threat actor purpose paper introduce novel method learn malicious behaviour estimate likely system compromise one difficulty encounter apply machine learn cyber security lack ground truth train supervise technique often compound volume variety velocity data far great process use human analysis technique know lewis create described author include data preparation processing phase learn later predict presence threat actor use model behaviour method address problem scale veracity learn indicator attack via feature extraction security intelligence obtain empirical method approach show promising classification performance detect learn malicious behaviour within synthesise system event data,0.0,0.12005146749040346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005146749040346,0.0,0.10178290708706107,0.0,0.0,0.0873700822682069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06991997380319848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2559747210407557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456437477655505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11091718728873226,0.0,0.0,0.10041022295758412,0.0,0.2676014172270467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5630782474386544,0.0,0.1287865436947531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3053487212611832,0.09172933803660037,0.0,0.10041022295758412,0.0,0.0,0.09288110914287248,0.1264558985134186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13937309475683493,0.13123092294669633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16931001506416168,0.1424103784029892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33784694846319263,0.10319426341960607,0.19554556102526596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22123874267991248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Securing the remote office: reducing cyber risks to remote working through regular security awareness education campaigns,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00809-5,29 January 2024,"Giddeon Njamngang Angafor, Iryna Yevseyeva, Leandros Maglaras","Cyber security threats, including risks to remote workers, are varied and diverse, with the number of scams and business email compromise breaches increasing. Firms and their staff are experiencing mass phishing attacks, several typical precursors to more sinister attacks like cyber-enabled fraud, ransomware, and denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Threat actors are leveraging new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver sophisticated scam and phishing messages that are challenging for users to identify as malicious. Several businesses are increasing technical efforts in critical areas, including network hardening, robust patching, anti-malware, ransomware detection applications, and multi-factor authentication to detect, prevent, and recover from potential threats. Despite that, these measures provide only a partial solution if the users who access the systems do not have good security awareness training. In this study, we review some cyber risks related to remote working and detail how they can be remediated through regular security awareness education campaigns (SAECs). The study presents the results of a proof of concept (PoC) experiment conducted to establish the value of regular SAECs in the fight against scams and phishing attacks against remote workers. The pilot results confirm that securing the remote office requires a robust SAEC. It argues that to be successful and help staff protect business systems and data, SAECs must be regular and varied, providing opportunities for staff to understand what to look for in suspicious scams and phishing emails. Moreover, they must provide opportunities for staff to practice their knowledge and understanding through practical exercises such as spam and phishing simulation exercises, which could help users avoid falling victim to spam and phishing emails.",cyber security threat include risk remote worker varied diverse number scam business email compromise breach increase firm staff experience mass phishing attack several typical precursor sinister attack like cyberenabled fraud ransomware denial service ddos attack threat actor leverage new technology machine learn artificial intelligence ai deliver sophisticated scam phishing message challenge user identify malicious several business increase technical effort critical area include network harden robust patch antimalware ransomware detection application multifactor authentication detect prevent recover potential threat despite measure provide partial solution user access system good security awareness training study review cyber risk related remote work detail remediate regular security awareness education campaign saecs study present result proof concept poc experiment conduct establish value regular saecs fight scam phishing attack remote worker pilot result confirm secure remote office require robust saec argues successful help staff protect business system data saecs must regular varied provide opportunity staff understand look suspicious scam phishing email moreover must provide opportunity staff practice knowledge understand practical exercise spam phishing simulation exercise could help user avoid fall victim spam phishing email,0.0,0.0,0.13821623685526424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834732096290415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29106163182841716,0.2545380655427331,0.0,0.3818070983140997,0.0952551502472878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11860523663018147,0.0,0.0,0.11646447584933003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07106210165495977,0.0,0.10168711976556669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10346292862322569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847528163643741,0.18758191510392808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114347485369774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306088315740291,0.09379095755196404,0.0,0.10725874519113544,0.0,0.0,0.10725874519113544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08362577494368605,0.09834732096290415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607566154158985,0.0952551502472878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23802752636285043,0.11369071470941434,0.0,0.1607456264766788,0.17936704964343808,0.10929452504680183,0.1410083634755863,0.11860523663018147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12129811999064946,0.0,0.14908243362952653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594443866390816,0.24428761229486814,0.0,0.0,0.1306088315740291,0.0,0.3725305861672507,0.0,0.0,0.0999838134634222

In response to these challenges, this research develops a comprehensive cyber-security trust model that provides multi-risk protection for secure data transmission in cloud computing, ensuring the highest level of privacy and data security. This innovative approach aims to ensure the secure transmission of data in cloud computing while harnessing the combined strengths of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Advanced Encryption Algorithm. As cloud environments become integral to modern business operations, safeguarding data against a multitude of security risks, including traditional and emerging threats, is paramount. The Cyber-Security Trust Model leverages blockchain to establish a transparent and tamper-resistant ledger of all data transactions within the cloud. This blockchain layer enhances data integrity, auditability, and traceability while also providing a decentralized and trust-based framework for authentication and authorization. The Multi-Risk Protection Model incorporates both Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and a Modified Advanced Encryption Standard (MAES) to offer multi-layered defence mechanisms. Through rigorous testing and analysis, this study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed Cyber-Security Trust Model with a Merkle tree-based solution for data integrity verification. It makes a significant impact on the field of secure data transmission in cloud computing by providing strong protection against a constantly changing set of security threats. MATLAB is employed to conduct rigorous experiments, analyse results, and validate the model’s performance in various cloud computing scenarios. The findings of the proposed study show the proposed method, combining Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Modified AES (MAES), stands out with exceptional performance, featuring encryption and decryption times of 2.25ms and 1.071ms, respectively.

A personalized learning theory-based cyber-security training exercise,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00704-z,02 June 2023,"Nabin Chowdhury, Vasileios Gkioulos","Current enterprises’ needs for skilled cyber-security (CS) professionals have prompted the development of diverse CS training programs and offerings. It has been noted that even though enterprise staff is now more aware of security threats, the number of successful attacks against companies has all but decreased over the years. Several criticisms were raised against current CS training offerings, which often made them inadequate, or unable to change participants’ behavior and security attitude. One of the main factors CS training programs are often not very effective is the lack of engagement or motivation of participants. This is often the result of training not being tailored to the needs or preferences of participants. In our previous work, we tackled this issue by developing a personalized learning theory-based model for developing CS training frameworks. In this work, we utilize the model to develop two CS training exercises: two game-based scenarios using the CS training video game Cyber CIEGE and one table-top team exercise. The exercises are later tested by involving a group of 12 students from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU) Information Security master’s degree program. According to the results of the experiment and the feedback from the students, students felt more engaged during the exercises due to having been participants in their development process.

A Comprehensive Review on Deep Learning Techniques on Cyber Attacks on Cyber Physical Systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-024-03253-x,20 September 2024,"Maloth Sagar, C. Vanmathi","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which integrate control, computing, and communication, are considered as next-generation intelligent systems.A major concern in CPS is to ensure security. If security is not ensured, then it leads to both property damage and casualties.Since CPS is closely associated with real life, it is a hot research area in present security research. Nevertheless, cyber security issues are also raised. More efforts are still required for understanding CPS security from a more comprehensive perspective even though there are several studies on CPS cybersecurity.To identify and detect cyber security in CPS, numerous methods have been applied. The majority of recently published studies focused on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, with little attention paid to the development of Deep Learning (DL). Hence, the analysis of cyber security on CPS utilizing several algorithms of DL techniques is systematically reviewed.The appropriate cyber security risk levels and their corresponding detection and mitigation processesare determined. This study could augment the adaptability of the system of CPS data. Also, it could increase the generalization of the models of security attacks in CPS. Using DL algorithms is strongly recommended by most authors as a means to identify cyber security issues in CPS.The CNN-centric LSTM, Deep Multi-architectural Approach, and DL-Meta classifier attained the highest accuracy in the detection rate of cyber security attacks in CPS when analogized with the other algorithms in DL techniques. Hence, for several critical systems in CPSs, the result renders clear guidelines to apply other regularization on DL techniques.",cyberphysical system cps integrate control compute communication consider nextgeneration intelligent systemsa major concern cps ensure security security ensure lead property damage casualtiessince cps closely associate real life hot research area present security research nevertheless cyber security issue also raise effort still require understand cps security comprehensive perspective even though several study cps cybersecurityto identify detect cyber security cps numerous method apply majority recently publish study focus machine learn ml technique little attention paid development deep learn dl hence analysis cyber security cps utilize several algorithm dl technique systematically reviewedthe appropriate cyber security risk level correspond detection mitigation processesare determine study could augment adaptability system cps data also could increase generalization model security attack cps use dl algorithm strongly recommend author mean identify cyber security issue cpsthe cnncentric lstm deep multiarchitectural approach dlmeta classifier attain high accuracy detection rate cyber security attack cps analogize algorithm dl technique hence several critical system cps result render clear guideline apply regularization dl technique,0.0633678689141871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2062983781877208,0.05796961176580061,0.0,0.04914821727358842,0.0,0.0,0.08437730674868893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05998676782452709,0.07572568996181754,0.0,0.06106213856073308,0.7919614843387386,0.20257480332943206,0.0,0.06106213856073308,0.0,0.04120109347206406,0.0,0.11791434333616199,0.06106213856073308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460874901787421,0.0,0.0,0.11997353564905418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054379056050098615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11045596056502482,0.0,0.10875811210019723,0.07378930812900156,0.06218754418175637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04914821727358842,0.044293620266996535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05522798028251241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591673556732497,0.09697077035120662,0.04659935062045055,0.05199760776883704,0.0,0.2997691920849825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296547485923716,0.0,0.0,0.21751622420039446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03561007149352725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Smart vehicles networks: BERT self-attention mechanisms for cyber-physical system security,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13198-023-02065-1,27 July 2023,Sultan Mesfer Aldossary,"People can freely communicate on a travel-related subject over the internet through IoT on smart vehicles to maintain their interpersonal relationships. Cyber security challenges are brought on by the rising use of smart vehicle communications and information. Attackers use the chance to fabricate communications to obtain users’ personal information from smart vehicles. It is a significant duty to distinguish genuine postings from phishing messages and violence among the millions of messages on smart vehicle networks. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) method with self-attention is proposed in this paper to process textual threats, vulnerability data, and cyber-attacks. The BERT-SA model is fine-tuned to enhance performance. The self-attention method of a proposed model determines the contextual relationships among words in a text input, i.e., governs the relative reputation of each word in the phrase by examining its exact placement inside the sentence. This model’s primary goal is to accurately carry out tasks specialized in cyber-security. The BERT model performs better than other neural networks models like CNN, RNN, and LSTM. Sentiment140, T4SA datasets are used to assess the effectiveness of the BERT model. The experimental results show that the proposed model enhances the accuracy by up to 96.65%.",people freely communicate travelrelated subject internet iot smart vehicle maintain interpersonal relationship cyber security challenge brought rise use smart vehicle communication information attacker use chance fabricate communication obtain user personal information smart vehicle significant duty distinguish genuine posting phishing message violence among million message smart vehicle network bidirectional encoder representation transformer bert method selfattention propose paper process textual threat vulnerability data cyberattacks bertsa model finetuned enhance performance selfattention method propose model determines contextual relationship among word text input ie governs relative reputation word phrase examine exact placement inside sentence model primary goal accurately carry task specialized cybersecurity bert model performs well neural network model like cnn rnn lstm sentiment tsa datasets use ass effectiveness bert model experimental result show propose model enhances accuracy,0.13331637920757106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11619128887200536,0.0,0.2524061112915451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07103110709292855,0.1284654724717338,0.0,0.1126798278118341,0.08668084780516461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386788078185036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20401178410620993,0.0,0.0,0.12403694158867361,0.14467349298441057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20680078038587332,0.652309383923168,0.0,0.20401178410620993,0.0,0.0,0.09435712932340318,0.1284654724717338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13331637920757106,0.28666421242880524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980379615820041,0.0,0.0,0.057333535077200286,0.0,0.12403694158867361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09932653669055777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2247545582415944,0.1514697064975723,0.0,0.1386788078185036,0.0
Improving patient centric data retrieval and cyber security in healthcare: privacy preserving solutions for a secure future,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-18253-5,31 January 2024,"S. Arunprasath, Suresh Annamalai","The healthcare industry is increasingly reliant on access to large volumes of patient data, which is critical for improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and ensuring regulatory compliance. However, there are significant challenges facing healthcare organizations in retrieving patient data from databases and ensuring the security and privacy of this data. Addressing these challenges is vital to the future success of the healthcare industry. This paper proposes two solutions to these challenges: a simplified ontology-based retrieval algorithm for healthcare multimedia data to enhance the retrieval process, and Hierarchical learning: ensemble model-based reinforcement learning to improve patient data security. An ontology-based retrieval algorithm was a method used to retrieve relevant information from large datasets. It filtered out irrelevant data and provided contextually relevant results. Hierarchical learning involved organizing learning tasks in a hierarchical structure, with higher-level policies guiding lower-level policies. Ensemble model-based reinforcement learning combined multiple models to improve the performance of a reinforcement learning system. The Simplified Ontology-Based Retrieval Algorithm had excellent performance with an accuracy of 92%, making it highly effective in information retrieval tasks. The paper highlights the importance of using advanced technologies and prioritizing cyber security in healthcare to maintain trust and optimal patient care.

Quantum communication based cyber security analysis using artificial intelligence with IoMT,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-023-06185-7,30 January 2024,"Huimin Han, Jun Yao, Yujun Wu, Yingyan Dou, Jingjuan Fu","Connected electronic devices used in healthcare, such as small sensors and actuators and other cyber-physical devices, make up what is known as the Internet of Medical Things. By linking these devices, medical monitoring, analysis, and reporting may become more intelligent and autonomous, ultimately benefiting the patient. To solve these problems, a thorough plan for monitoring and assessing method health needs to be formulated. The application of traditional machine learning to massive datasets in a shared computing environment may lead to model training and computation that is either too slow to provide accurate results or too fast to produce erroneous results as a consequence of rushed training, both of which are detrimental. Key 6G enablers may be seen of as the upcoming paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing, and quantum ML (QML), as well as their synergies with communication networks. This research presents a new machine learning approach to medical cyber physical system (CPS) predictive maintenance using swarm robots. In this case, we use fog computing-integrated soft sensors to conduct a thorough closed-loop dynamic analysis of the CPS predictive maintenance. Extreme learning utilising a weighted sliding window. The investigation of medical security is then conducted using a kernel decision making system based on probabilistic swarm robotics. In terms of training accuracy, energy use, convergence ratio, precision, and F_measure, an experimental study is conducted. The system's ability to (i) avoid unscheduled downtime and (ii) consequently increase operational availability sets it apart from other systems.

Temple, Yue Wu, Carmen Cheh, Yuan Li, Binbin Chen, Zbigniew T. Kalbarczyk, William H. Sanders, David Nicol","Cyber risk assessment is a critical step in securing the digital systems that support modern society. Typically this is a manual process carried out by consultants or working groups with little or no software support outside of spreadsheet tools. As cybersecurity threats and digital systems themselves become more complex and dynamic, there is a need for greater tool support in the risk assessment process to document and trace assumptions and facilitate the revision or extension of a threat and risk assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle. The Cyber Security Argument Graph Evaluation (CyberSAGE) tool provides a platform for model-based cybersecurity analysis of cyber failure and attack scenarios. It combines models of high-level workflow, system architecture, device properties, attacker capability and skill, to compute holistic, quantitative security metrics. In this paper we describe the models, algorithms, and software architecture of the CyberSAGE tool. To illustrate its application, we describe an assessment carried out on communication systems in two railway lines with the support of an industry partner. Finally, we summarize feedback on the CyberSAGE tool from the railway case study partner, as well as over 40 interviews with practitioners and domain experts and a multinational electronics company who carried out a one year independent evaluation.",cyber risk assessment critical step secure digital system support modern society typically manual process carry consultant work group little software support outside spreadsheet tool cybersecurity threat digital system become complex dynamic need great tool support risk assessment process document trace assumption facilitate revision extension threat risk assessment throughout system lifecycle cyber security argument graph evaluation cybersage tool provide platform modelbased cybersecurity analysis cyber failure attack scenario combine model highlevel workflow system architecture device property attacker capability skill compute holistic quantitative security metric paper describe model algorithm software architecture cybersage tool illustrate application describe assessment carry communication system two railway line support industry partner finally summarize feedback cybersage tool railway case study partner well interview practitioner domain expert multinational electronics company carry one year independent evaluation,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11299829065654816,0.09525717696527805,0.09369804803906213,0.0,0.2557867278208656,0.5267288004938255,0.06932549482378274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09857182037584596,0.12443442744886926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16643809835588955,0.0,0.0,0.17601880858138189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22117659748743276,0.11299829065654816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058829874371638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14556886257069254,0.10218819344676701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07369832652034143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082554676218262,0.0,0.0755916696777736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2563314730320147,0.1041277338109131,0.08956155446829482,0.0,0.0,0.14055275696909142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710173540633027,0.0,0.4850100574064216,0.0,0.0,0.15515943703767995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09525717696527805

Anand, V. Murugesh","This study develops an active security control strategy for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that are subject to attacks known as Denial-of-Service (DoS), which can target both channels from the controller to the actuator and from the controller to the sensor. Due to attack cost restrictions, the linked channels are subject to a limit on the number of continuous DoS attacks. A proactive security control method is then developed to combat two-channel DoS attacks, depending on a method for identifying IoT intrusions. Using the CICIDS dataset for attack detection, we examined the effectiveness of the Deep Convolutional Network Model (DCNM), a suggested deep learning model. The addressed CPS can be asymptotically stable against DoS assaults under the security controller's active security control technique without sacrificing control performance. Recent tests and simulations show how effective the security control strategy is active. The proposed model gives better trade-off compared to existing approaches like Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Supervised Neural Networks (SNN) and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNN).

Mvula, Paula Branco, Guy-Vincent Jourdan, Herna L. Viktor","In Machine Learning, the datasets used to build models are one of the main factors limiting what these models can achieve and how good their predictive performance is. Machine Learning applications for cyber-security or computer security are numerous including cyber threat mitigation and security infrastructure enhancement through pattern recognition, real-time attack detection, and in-depth penetration testing. Therefore, for these applications in particular, the datasets used to build the models must be carefully thought to be representative of real-world data. However, because of the scarcity of labelled data and the cost of manually labelling positive examples, there is a growing corpus of literature utilizing Semi-Supervised Learning with cyber-security data repositories.

Security strategy for autonomous vehicle cyber-physical systems using transfer learning,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13677-023-00564-x,20 December 2023,"Abdulaziz A. Alsulami, Qasem Abu Al-Haija, Badraddin Alturki, Ali Alqahtani, Raed Alsini","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are emergent systems that enable effective real-time communication and collaboration (C&C) of physical components such as control systems, sensors, actuators, and the surrounding environment through a cyber communication infrastructure. As such, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the fields that have significantly adopted the CPS approach to improving people's lives in smart cities by reducing energy consumption and air pollution. Therefore, autonomous vehicle-cyber physical systems (AV-CPSs) have attracted enormous investments from major corporations and are projected to be widely used. However, AV-CPS is vulnerable to cyber and physical threat vectors due to the deep integration of information technology (IT), including cloud computing, with the communication process. Cloud computing is critical in providing the scalable infrastructure required for real-time data processing, storage, and analysis in AV-CPS, allowing these systems to work seamlessly in smart cities. CPS components such as sensors and control systems through network infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks targeted by attackers using the communication system. This paper proposes an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) for AV-CPS using transfer learning to identify cyberattacks launched against connected physical components of AVs through a network infrastructure. First, AV-CPS was developed by implementing the controller area network (CAN) and integrating it into the AV simulation model. Second, the dataset was generated from the AV-CPS. The collected dataset was then preprocessed to be trained and tested via pre-trained CNNs. Third, eight pre-trained networks were implemented, namely, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet. The performance of the implemented models was evaluated. According to the experimental evaluation results, GoogLeNet outperformed all other pre-rained networks, scoring an F1- score of 99.47%.",cyberphysical system cps emergent system enable effective realtime communication collaboration cc physical component control system sensor actuator surround environment cyber communication infrastructure autonomous vehicle av one field significantly adopt cps approach improve people life smart city reduce energy consumption air pollution therefore autonomous vehiclecyber physical system avcpss attract enormous investment major corporation project widely use however avcps vulnerable cyber physical threat vector due deep integration information technology include cloud compute communication process cloud compute critical provide scalable infrastructure require realtime data processing storage analysis avcps allow system work seamlessly smart city cps component sensor control system network infrastructure particularly vulnerable cyberattacks target attacker use communication system paper proposes intelligent intrusion detection system iids avcps use transfer learn identify cyberattacks launch connect physical component av network infrastructure first avcps developed implement controller area network integrate av simulation model second dataset generate avcps collect dataset preprocessed train test via pretrained cnns third eight pretrained network implement namely inceptionv resnet shufflenet mobilenetv googlenet resnet squeezenet alexnet performance implement model evaluate accord experimental evaluation result googlenet outperform prerained network score f score,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08007818603330025,0.0,0.0678924692809717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22139794721407913,0.331458597500754,0.20921223046175058,0.0,0.16870029459615127,0.298364030624907,0.09327773806852596,0.16870029459615127,0.08435014729807563,0.0,0.05691445444141784,0.0,0.08144238363899288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08924937162136404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828646493751885,0.0,0.2849768939910422,0.08435014729807563,0.07398532765713597,0.0,0.0,0.06697684486268626,0.37186532887211116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511825651494283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12237283141238646,0.0,0.3348842243134313,0.0,0.0,0.06195468404013268,0.08435014729807563,0.39781870749987597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08753524201515715,0.0,0.06354632774001888,0.09105620087285411,0.0,0.06437151042327476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883388930122968,0.06521758601167886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475733497011327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08007818603330025
Dependency-based security risk assessment for cyber-physical systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-022-00608-4,22 August 2022,"Aida Akbarzadeh, Sokratis K. Katsikas","A cyber-physical attack is a security breach in cyber space that impacts on the physical environment. The number and diversity of such attacks against Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasing at impressive rates. In times of Industry 4.0 and Cyber-Physical Systems, providing security against cyber-physical attacks is a serious challenge which calls for cybersecurity risk assessment methods capable of investigating the tight interactions and interdependencies between the cyber and the physical components in such systems. However, existing risk assessment methods do not consider this specific characteristic of CPSs. In this paper, we propose a dependency-based, domain-agnostic cybersecurity risk assessment method that leverages a model of the CPS under study that captures dependencies among the system components. The proposed method identifies possible attack paths against critical components of a CPS by taking an attacker’s viewpoint and prioritizes these paths according to their risk to materialize, thus allowing the defenders to define efficient security controls. We illustrate the workings of the proposed method by applying it to a case study of a CPS in the energy domain, and we highlight the advantages that the proposed method offers when used to assess cybersecurity risks in CPSs.",cyberphysical attack security breach cyber space impact physical environment number diversity attack cyberphysical system cps increase impressive rate time industry cyberphysical system provide security cyberphysical attack serious challenge call cybersecurity risk assessment method capable investigate tight interaction interdependency cyber physical component system however exist risk assessment method consider specific characteristic cps paper propose dependencybased domainagnostic cybersecurity risk assessment method leverage model cps study capture dependency among system component propose method identifies possible attack path critical component cps take attacker viewpoint prioritizes path accord risk materialize thus allow defender define efficient security control illustrate working propose method apply case study cps energy domain highlight advantage propose method offer use ass cybersecurity risk cps,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.303157691212769,0.2128007878893987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06964288249127738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699979826707101,0.5447286318797493,0.0851494306074442,0.0,0.30799919306828405,0.2026145354859121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0867145822146353,0.0,0.08147209969916278,0.0867145822146353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699979826707101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06857238289560935,0.08486516094775043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37185754424455414,0.055854575445056856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05655589617327408,0.0,0.18157621062658308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22909488028402367,0.05800884258451393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3278467969631057,0.0,0.10309394150682363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10899705034133204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486516094775043,0.0,0.0,0.044904557650734464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Socio Cyber-Physical System for Cyber-Attack Detection in Brand Marketing Communication Network,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-024-11261-6,18 June 2024,"SiFan Yang, Haiming Long","Brand truthfulness, consumer trust, and economic security are all seriously dangerous from sophisticated cyberattacks targeting brand communication networks in today’s digitally driven marketplace. This study aims to improve the identification and mitigation of cyber risks in these systems by introducing the Socio-Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) architecture. The suggested SCPS framework combines social behaviour analytics, physical network monitoring, and powerful artificial intelligence to establish a comprehensive and flexible security system. The proposed method processes the brand marketing area, such as Alluring ads, and the SCPS helps to identify the cyber-attacks in ads. Initially, it collects the URL structure dataset and pre-processes the data. Then, the SCPS is integrated with the system to identify any attacks in the URL dataset. Next, the dataset will be trained using deep learning methods such as Deep Maxout Network (DMN). An experimental setup in a fictitious brand communication network shows how well the system recognises and reacts to different types of cyberattacks. The SCPS framework is a new strategy that contributes to digital marketing administration and cyber security by bringing together the social, technological, and physical domains to protect digital marketing assets. The evaluation of the trial showed effective and precise detection of phishing attacks. According to the performance evaluation, the DMN algorithm beat other applied models with a maximum accuracy and precision of 96% during the training and 93% during the testing phases. Based on URL, text, and image attributes, the algorithms distinguished between phishing and authentic websites with these precision values.

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly significant in critical infrastructure, government, and daily life. Using persons, processes, technology, and policies to protect businesses, their sensitive data, and critical systems from Internet threats. Several researchers developed and analyzed the security system for protecting confidential information. The existing security system lacks sufficient accuracy, which results in cyber-attacks. A Mathematically Modified Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (MMANFIS) is used to attain efficiency and handle complex data. The proposed MMANFIS is effective in attaining an accuracy of 96% by retrieving significant features where the MMANFIS classifier accomplishes the classification. To demonstrate the proposed MMANFIS, the output classifier is compared with the results of the current methodologies. Two fuzzy inference-based rules are taken into consideration to clarify this MMANFIS model. The current and proposed optimum feature selection algorithms have examined the classifiers’ effectiveness using full and best features. The proposed MMANFIS approach outperforms in terms of accuracy, which attains 95% accuracy, and the accuracy rate is higher than the existing techniques.

Mubeen Tajudeen, M. Syed Ali, R. Perumal, Hamed Alsulami, Bashir Ahmad","This article investigates the observer-based security control of discrete-time Markov jump systems (MJSs) subject to hybrid cyber-attacks and unmeasured states via event-triggered scheme. The event-triggered scheme (ETS) is being developed to relieve more network burdens. A Luenburger observer is used to estimate the unmeasured states. In this work, the hybrid cyber attack is addressed, which contains deception attacks and DoS attacks. It is anticipated that input control signals sent across a network are vulnerable to hybrid cyber-attacks in which adversaries could inject fake data into the control signals. Since system state information is usually not fully known, an observer-based controller is built to stabilize the system and keep the right performance index even when hybrid cyber-attacks happen. By solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the controllers and observers are also obtained. Lastly, inverted pendulum applications are shown to show how well and realistically the theoretical results can be used to respond to and get rid of the effects of hybrid cyber-attacks.",article investigates observerbased security control discretetime markov jump system mjss subject hybrid cyberattacks unmeasured state via eventtriggered scheme eventtriggered scheme ets developed relieve network burden luenburger observer use estimate unmeasured state work hybrid cyber attack address contains deception attack do attack anticipate input control signal sent across network vulnerable hybrid cyberattacks adversary could inject fake data control signal since system state information usually fully know observerbased controller built stabilize system keep right performance index even hybrid cyberattacks happen solve linear matrix inequality lmis controller observer also obtain lastly invert pendulum application show show well realistically theoretical result use respond get rid effect hybrid cyberattacks,0.0,0.15196731622408818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14947997987723483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3317926185693287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.480223122286932,0.0,0.08850829557897738,0.6402974963825759,0.0,0.0,0.10800865159737373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12710441965689545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2542088393137909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16007437409564398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12216018075444439,0.0,0.0,0.07144043894123253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867035790159222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15196731622408818

Various services, such as quality of service (QoS) for smart cyber security management from the industrial domain, are complicated for us. It is challenging to select the optimal malicious nodes by taking into account QoS criteria, including information communication, and network coverage regions. Numerous constrained evolutionary optimization strategies are known to address these problems. This study proposes a broader definition of differential evolution (DE) that uses a quick adaptation strategy and an optimization-based design. It combines DE with a unique mutation approach to broaden the range of viable answers. This research also suggests a novel fitness function for energy harvesting in IoT-based applications. Both on the IIoT-service architecture and in IIoT-based applications, the suggested method is assessed. The outcomes are then contrasted using state-of-the-art algorithms. It is discovered that the proposed approach produces better results in terms of cyber security of QoS, fitness cost, and detection of IIoT nodes from the IIoT service network.",industrial internet thing iiot evolve quickly start twentyfirst century various service quality service qos smart cyber security management industrial domain complicate u challenge select optimal malicious node take account qos criterion include information communication network coverage region numerous constrain evolutionary optimization strategy know address problem study proposes broader definition differential evolution de us quick adaptation strategy optimizationbased design combine de unique mutation approach broaden range viable answer research also suggests novel fitness function energy harvest iotbased application iiotservice architecture iiotbased application suggest method assess outcome contrast use stateoftheart algorithm discover propose approach produce well result term cyber security qos fitness cost detection iiot node iiot service network,0.0,0.14094149924863994,0.0,0.0,0.16719106113624047,0.0,0.27726925756177234,0.2389880910682268,0.18922965206137402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342757714669356,0.0,0.1458458101535322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16417335233384248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1511965570336734,0.14334255333517693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16719106113624047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13021777239137666,0.0,0.0,0.1178825020582391,0.0,0.0,0.14334255333517693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16362526290252394,0.0,0.1194940455341134,0.0,0.0,0.2357650041164782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16362526290252394,0.0,0.11042726366587208,0.0,0.0,0.1178825020582391,0.11329698682463883,0.0,0.0,0.13251431717739603,0.5015731834087215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081325603848804,0.10507651678573084,0.15708323160670942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657875586480857,0.0,0.1540662801924402,0.0,0.0

Cybersecurity should also be adapting to these changes to ensure security of personal data and continuation of operations. This article starts with a comparison of existing cybersecurity standards and regulations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)—ISO27001, followed by a discussion on more specific and recent standards and regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO), and more general cryptography (and post-quantum cryptography), in the context of cybersecurity. These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)—cloud, and US standards—The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation’s.

Generally, the phishing method is used by hackers to access the data without the influence of users whose data was stolen. Several techniques are used to detect whether the data is phished or non-phished. Some anti-phishing software is used to identify the phishing data. However, few of these techniques did not provide efficient performance. Hence, the proposed model is introduced to overcome the issues obtained and improve the efficiency of detecting whether the data is phished or non-phished. The data is gathered from the Phishstorm dataset, which is pre-processed using the Z score normalization method and data cleaning. Data balancing is done by the Advanced synthetic sampling approach (Adv-SyN) to balance the dataset, and the features are extracted using a Double self-sparse autoencoder (DSelSa). The Opposition Gazelle optimization algorithm (OpGoA) model is used for optimal feature selection, and finally, the data is classified using Multi Head Depth wise Tern integrated long short term memory (MDepthNet). The sooty tern optimization is used to evaluate the loss function of the network model. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed based on some evaluation metrics and compared with other models, which describes the efficiency of the proposed model. The main objective of proposed technique used to detect the phishing attack and phishing or non-phishing. An automated DL methodology introduced for effective detection of phishing attacks for enhancing the cyber security. The accuracy of the proposed model is obtained as 99.45%, and Precision is 99.45%.

Cyber security analysis based medical image encryption in cloud IoT network using quantum deep learning model,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-023-06076-x,27 January 2024,Jing Wang,"A very high degree of security is required for the transmission of medical pictures via open access as these images are more important than other types of images in most applications, especially real-time applications like telemedicine. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made the privacy and security of patient medical picture data an urgent issue in the field of image privacy protection. By combining quantum deep learning with cyber security research of cloud IoT networks, this study proposes a novel approach to encrypting medical photos. Here, a stream crypto cypher and deep, extreme convolutional networks encrypt the medical image. Afterwards, this encrypted picture was stored using a secure cloud IoT infrastructure. Encryption speed, structural similarity index measure (SSIM), root mean square error (RMSE), mean average precision (MAP), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are all used in the experimental investigation. To determine the efficacy of the proposed approach, experimental analyses and simulations were carried out.

From scattered data to actionable knowledge: flexible cyber security reporting in the military domain,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-022-00613-7,14 September 2022,"Florian Skopik, Arndt Bonitz, Volker Grantz, Günter Göhler","Numerous cyber situational awareness models have been proposed in recent years. Yet, one of the main challenges still remains mostly unsolved, which is what information sources contribute to the process for establishing cyber situational awareness and how is relevant information collected. While previous scientific works focused on situational awareness models and decision support based on common operating pictures, ingesting and maintaining a consistent data basis for the cyber domain has rarely been studied in detail. However, this is crucial when data distributed across different systems need to be collected, vetted, correlated, de-duplicated, enriched and finally stored as a basis for flexible cyber security reporting. In this paper, we design an approach and a data model that enable to ingest and store the essential information from disparate organizational units and act as a basis for the flexible creation of cyber security reports. We describe the application of this approach and model in a case study together with the Austrian Ministry of Defense (MoD), in which we surveyed existing data sources and transfer paths and rated the applicability of the CCOP data model and accompanying processes in course of a proof-of-concept implementation.",numerous cyber situational awareness model propose recent year yet one main challenge still remains mostly unsolved information source contribute process establish cyber situational awareness relevant information collect previous scientific work focus situational awareness model decision support base common operating picture ingest maintain consistent data basis cyber domain rarely study detail however crucial data distribute across different system need collect vet correlate deduplicated enrich finally store basis flexible cyber security reporting paper design approach data model enable ingest store essential information disparate organizational unit act basis flexible creation cyber security report describe application approach model case study together austrian ministry defense mod survey exist data source transfer path rat applicability ccop data model accompany process course proofofconcept implementation,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902325977040339,0.1879419374775749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42325356760234467,0.10397228749280922,0.0,0.10559542332420031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3227677348052704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39388068188871966,0.11890204964537304,0.0,0.0,0.11675028377677729,0.0,0.13148024162386496,0.0,0.0,0.13148024162386496,0.0,0.12353137246899656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781109184039399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42344510506532906,0.11890204964537304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857523925527405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423176407653204,0.08684078688166155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421020312149262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16526584282785367,0.0,0.14108452253411488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11083739914145543

Hyper-heuristic multi-objective online optimization for cyber security in big data,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13198-022-01727-w,17 July 2022,"Mohammed Ahmed, G. Rama Mohan Babu","The tremendous growth in data inside the Big data era has created data management challenges as well as data security concerns. These large data cyber security challenges can be successfully addressed with AI computations, with the SVM providing the best results on big data order issues. Master information in picking the kernel work and different boundaries is required to characterize the correct design of the SVM, and this can significantly advance its arrangement outcomes. The fake positive rate, bogus negative rate, and model unpredictability boundaries addressed using the SVM arrangement process is shown to be a multi-objective optimization problem in this study. The hyper-heuristic online particle swarm optimization (HHOPSO) computation with the SVM multi-objective optimization problem, a hyper-heuristic online particle swarm optimization system is produced was presented. The hyper-heuristic system comprises a high-level technique for directing the search process for determining low-level heuristics, and the low-level heuristics build new SVM setup configurations using various PSO standards. The proposed HHOPSO was evaluated on two cyber security datasets i.e., NSL-KDD and ISCX-IDS. The results revealed that the suggested approach is more effective than other calculations in refining the order of big data cyber security issues.

Proposed cancelable biometrics system based on hybrid optical crypto-steganography audio framework for cyber security applications,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-18232-w,08 July 2024,Mai Helmy,"Biometric authentication systems have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their high level of security and convenience. Cancelable biometrics is a promising area of research that addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with traditional biometric systems. By transforming the biometric data in a non-invertible manner, cancelable biometrics offer enhanced privacy protection, increased security, and the flexibility to revoke or update biometric templates. As research in this field continues to advance, cancelable biometrics has the potential to revolutionize the way biometric systems are implemented and utilized. Ten years ago, there is a dire need to develop new cancelable biometric systems depending on cryptography or steganography system which may merging the two previous techniques to hide secret information within a cover medium. It involves encrypting the message and then embedding it into an innocent-looking file, such as an image or audio file. The goal is to make the hidden message undetectable to anyone who is not the intended recipient. This method ensures that even if the cover medium is intercepted, the secret information remains secure. Crypto-steganography is a powerful tool for covert communication and has applications in various fields, including intelligence agencies, cyber-security, and digital multimedia applications. In a classical cryptography system, users can easily change their password if they are compromised. However, user's biometrics is limited and unique, and if they are compromised, it will be impossible to change them as it in cryptography system. So, the basic concept of cancelable biometrics is to use another version of the original biometric template created through a one-way transform or a crypto-steganography scheme to keep the original biometrics safe and away from utilization in the system. Cancelable biometrics depends on the transformation of data so that users can replace their single biometric template in the same or different system. In this paper, a biometric system is presented as a novel hybrid optical crypto-steganography algorithm which is used to achieve cancelability option over audios signal. A proposal hybrid crypto-steganography technique based on the optical Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE) algorithm which is suggested to attain simultaneous encryption of multi-audios, begins with encrypting the biometric audios using the optical DRPE algorithm, then the resulting encrypted biometric audios are further encrypted again with the chaotic Baker map as a permutation strategy, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and Ron's Code (RC6) as a diffusion strategy. Then, the resulting encrypted biometrics is embedded into the cover media with a steganography technique which is based on a chaotic concept. Finally, the quality evaluation of the proposed cancelable biometrics system reveals good performance. The simulation results prove that the suggested hybrid optical crypto-steganography framework is reliable and presents recommended security and robustness levels for its utilization in achieving efficient cancelable biometrics systems compared to traditional techniques.",biometric authentication system gain significant popularity recent year due high level security convenience cancelable biometrics promising area research address privacy security concern associate traditional biometric system transform biometric data noninvertible manner cancelable biometrics offer enhance privacy protection increase security flexibility revoke update biometric template research field continue advance cancelable biometrics potential revolutionize way biometric system implement utilized ten year ago dire need develop new cancelable biometric system depend cryptography steganography system may merge two previous technique hide secret information within cover medium involves encrypt message embed innocentlooking file image audio file goal make hidden message undetectable anyone intend recipient method ensures even cover medium intercept secret information remains secure cryptosteganography powerful tool covert communication application various field include intelligence agency cybersecurity digital multimedia application classical cryptography system user easily change password compromise however user biometrics limited unique compromise impossible change cryptography system basic concept cancelable biometrics use another version original biometric template create oneway transform cryptosteganography scheme keep original biometrics safe away utilization system cancelable biometrics depends transformation data user replace single biometric template different system paper biometric system present novel hybrid optical cryptosteganography algorithm use achieve cancelability option audio signal proposal hybrid cryptosteganography technique base optical double random phase encode drpe algorithm suggest attain simultaneous encryption multiaudios begin encrypt biometric audio use optical drpe algorithm result encrypt biometric audio encrypt chaotic baker map permutation strategy advanced encryption standard aes ron code rc diffusion strategy result encrypt biometrics embed cover medium steganography technique base chaotic concept finally quality evaluation propose cancelable biometrics system reveals good performance simulation result prove suggest hybrid optical cryptosteganography framework reliable present recommend security robustness level utilization achieve efficient cancelable biometrics system compare traditional technique,0.0,0.09482994986877483,0.0,0.0,0.33747448474534264,0.0,0.18655562722764932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1779126339495135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981297271503501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761468335251117,0.13479812989879458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09988887905595116,0.11009231178205436,0.0,0.10783030175562507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09644545587568086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11249149491511419,0.0,0.08761468335251117,0.08895631697475676,0.0,0.15863023765438528,0.0,0.10569062382549578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24141739706640436,0.0,0.09178426271619175,0.0,0.0,0.08039941683624753,0.0,0.10172988083900324,0.0,0.09327781361382466,0.0,0.07336779056431673,0.09988887905595116,0.0,0.11009231178205436,0.1806900699181181,0.0,0.0,0.07429899591962572,0.0,0.0,0.15863023765438528,0.22868951241770094,0.0,0.10366072239194452,0.178319744316877,0.0,0.09644545587568086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20732144478388903,0.0,0.21138124765099156,0.0,0.355825267899027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17475887064057716,0.35332775963530977,0.10366072239194452,0.0,0.0

Many important application fields such as transportation, energy, and medical systems employ Cyber-physical systems as the basic engineering systems which we conclude from various researches. The rapid and important development of CPS is affecting many aspects of people's lifestyles, enabling a wide range of applications and services such as Smart Home, E-Health, and ecommerce. They have the capability to consolidate sensor networks with implanted processing to screen and control the actual environment, with input circles that permits this outside boost to self-initiate either correspondence, control or registering. In spite of their various benefits, CPS frameworks are inclined to different digital and additionally actual security dangers, assaults and difficulties. This is because of their heterogeneous nature, their dependence on private information, and their enormous scope arrangement. Thus, purposeful or unplanned openings of these frameworks can result in calamitous impacts, which makes it basic to set up vigorous safety efforts. Currently, there is an increase in the present security confrontation with the epidemic growth of cyber-physical systems. There has been an influx of susceptibility, risks, attacks, and controls for the emerging latest generation of CPS.

Cloud servers are often used to manage the massive amounts of data generated by these IoT devices. Current improvements in electronic and communication technology have greatly impacted the e-healthcare sector owing to the effective exchange of patient data. IoMTs, or the Internet of Medical Things, are a relatively recent development in the field of remote health monitoring. They are used in patient-centric systems for the transmission and tracking of patient data. Authentication and anomaly detection are two areas where modern medical systems make extensive use of encryption, biometrics, and machine learning (ML) technology. This study suggests a new method for assessing the cyber security of e-healthcare apps; one that makes use of quantum machine learning. Users of e-healthcare applications have been tracked and analysed to identify risky behaviours. A deep variational adversarial encoder network and a fuzzy Gaussian quantile neural network classify the characteristics of observed user activity data, leading to the identification of malicious users and an increase in network security.

Cyber security risk assessment in autonomous shipping,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41278-022-00214-0,26 January 2022,"Hasan Mahbub Tusher, Ziaul Haque Munim, Theo E. Notteboom, Tae-Eun Kim, Salman Nazir","Autonomous ships would require higher cyber-physical interaction in comparison with traditional shipping operations, thus increasing the vulnerabilities associated with cyber security. The increasing complexity surrounding the innate characteristics of the shipping industry makes it challenging to build a resilient framework for ensuring cyber security. This study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for assessing cyber security risk in the autonomous shipping context. The research was validated through surveying subject matter experts, system designers and seafarers. Different types of equipment and systems are ranked based on their perceived vulnerability to cyber threats. Survey data from 28 subject matter experts are collected and analysed through the Bayesian best–worst method (BWM). At system level, the results indicate that navigational systems are the most vulnerable to potential cyber threats, while propulsion systems are the least vulnerable element in the context of future autonomous shipping operations. On a sub-system level, the three most vulnerable parts are Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) and the communication devices on shore control centres (SCC), while the least vulnerable parts are engine controls, SCC integration platforms and cargo handling at ports.",autonomous ship would require high cyberphysical interaction comparison traditional shipping operation thus increase vulnerability associate cyber security increase complexity surround innate characteristic shipping industry make challenge build resilient framework ensure cyber security study proposes multicriteria decisionmaking mcdm framework assess cyber security risk autonomous shipping context research validate survey subject matter expert system designer seafarer different type equipment system ranked base perceive vulnerability cyber threat survey data subject matter expert collect analyse bayesian bestworst method bwm system level result indicate navigational system vulnerable potential cyber threat propulsion system least vulnerable element context future autonomous shipping operation subsystem level three vulnerable part global navigation satellite system gnss electronic chart display information system ecdis communication device shore control centre scc least vulnerable part engine control scc integration platform cargo handle port,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13071153103017913,0.0,0.1327520994807458,0.0,0.1441908490774842,0.0,0.0,0.2935514589255503,0.0,0.4057760563020947,0.0,0.14677572946277515,0.0,0.09903551843359455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14677572946277515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2834319950991496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26142306206035826,0.16176855244319205,0.11654484997040632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547363319552122,0.0,0.13486688649119868,0.0,0.0,0.11813810672469348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16176855244319205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15844477731608003,0.11654484997040632,0.1120113681083321,0.12498721778306963,0.0,0.1965159495012311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388417848609764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2269672091226764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31688955463216006,0.0
Tracing the evolution of cyber resilience: a historical and conceptual review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00811-x,01 February 2024,"Vasiliki Tzavara, Savvas Vassiliadis","In 2000, during a time when cyber security research was focused on the risks and threats posed by digital systems, the notion of being able to withstand and recover from cyber attacks, also known as cyber resilience, emerged. Recently, this concept has gained increasing attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid acceleration of digitalization. While experts acknowledge the distinction between cyber security and cyber resilience, the exact definition and evolution of the latter remain somewhat ambiguous. The aim of this paper is to offer a thorough comprehension of how the notion of cyber resilience has developed throughout history. It delves into the concept of cyber resilience and its progression over time in response to the rising frequency and complexity of cyber threats. Cyber resilience, a new concept, has gained significant recognition as a critical component of cyber security strategy across diverse sectors, encompassing public and private domains alike. It begins with an overview of the definition and key components of cyber resilience and then traces the origin of the concept from its early development in the 2000s. The paper also explores the major milestones and events that have shaped the evolution of this capacity, including changes in technology and societal factors, up to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This study provides valuable insights into future challenges for ensuring the continued resilience of digital infrastructure by examining the historical and contextual factors that have influenced the concept.",time cyber security research focus risk threat pose digital system notion able withstand recover cyber attack also know cyber resilience emerge recently concept gain increase attention due covid pandemic rapid acceleration digitalization expert acknowledge distinction cyber security cyber resilience exact definition evolution latter remain somewhat ambiguous aim paper offer thorough comprehension notion cyber resilience developed throughout history delf concept cyber resilience progression time response rise frequency complexity cyber threat cyber resilience new concept gain significant recognition critical component cyber security strategy across diverse sector encompass public private domain alike begin overview definition key component cyber resilience trace origin concept early development paper also explores major milestone event shape evolution capacity include change technology societal factor covid pandemic outbreak study provide valuable insight future challenge ensure continued resilience digital infrastructure examine historical contextual factor influence concept,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11565060788619926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08416726039765471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101809947909244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7409252387365248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12182026458811454,0.0,0.2685278817253488,0.13718988343833372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12889582784979406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10685117311035536,0.10848737289943018,0.0,0.0,0.1342639408626744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375768796316234,0.0,0.1789525269131139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09177494891071461,0.0,0.09672937420745539,0.0,0.10373633294956583,0.0,0.16310343032630634,0.0,0.11762081088642258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12642024566226648,0.08622132661861448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09941135701485716,0.18837723082250243,0.2685278817253488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, consumer data stored within the IoT infrastructure is susceptible to cyber-security risks. Government regulations mandate that platforms invest in IoT cyber-defense improvements, necessitating supply chain collaboration. Motivated by this observation, this study seeks to determine when platforms should enhance IoT cyber-defense levels and assess the impact of such improvements on the e-commerce supply chain under government regulations. We develop a stylized game-theoretic model and conduct a comparative analysis to investigate firms’ equilibrium decisions. Numerical studies are also performed to validate our results. Our findings reveal that setting a higher IoT functionality level benefits manufacturers through enhanced cyber-defense. Additionally, even when the cost of cyber-defense improvement is negligible, platforms may not economically benefit from such improvements if the unit penalty is high and defense efforts are low. Finally, we find that cyber-defense improvements can generate a win-win outcome for manufacturers, platforms, and consumers when defense efforts are high and the cost of improvement is low. Our results suggest that manufacturers should invest more in IoT when cyber-security risks are effectively mitigated. Platforms must carefully weigh the penalty, defense level, and cyber-defense improvement costs in their cyber-security investments. Furthermore, to ensure that cyber-defense improvements benefit social welfare, governments are advised to judiciously set penalties, particularly when defense levels are low.",manufacturer employ platform iot infrastructure service produce iot product sell platform however consumer data store within iot infrastructure susceptible cybersecurity risk government regulation mandate platform invest iot cyberdefense improvement necessitate supply chain collaboration motivate observation study seek determine platform enhance iot cyberdefense level ass impact improvement ecommerce supply chain government regulation develop stylize gametheoretic model conduct comparative analysis investigate firm equilibrium decision numerical study also perform validate result finding reveal set high iot functionality level benefit manufacturer enhance cyberdefense additionally even cost cyberdefense improvement negligible platform may economically benefit improvement unit penalty high defense effort low finally find cyberdefense improvement generate winwin outcome manufacturer platform consumer defense effort high cost improvement low result suggest manufacturer invest iot cybersecurity risk effectively mitigate platform must carefully weigh penalty defense level cyberdefense improvement cost cybersecurity investment furthermore ensure cyberdefense improvement benefit social welfare government advise judiciously set penalty particularly defense level low,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08760013057954953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10391516242799897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428048642750492,0.06226057167252432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1992186756883503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09227336786378924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2033977852199204,0.0,0.0,0.7274061369959929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4460235513454714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06693380895676403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408361751934981,0.15715120704194752,0.0,0.0,0.10391516242799897,0.0,0.0,0.12109720541079948,0.0,0.0,0.1306175489879795,0.09763278859642295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Failure of datacentre operation is not an option and can be catastrophic. Internet of things (IoT) devices in datacentre can automate management tasks and reduce human intervention and error. IoT devices can be used to manage many datacentre routine tasks such as monitoring physical infrastructure, updating software and configuration, monitoring network traffic, and automating alerting reports to respective authorities. The physical and cyber security of the datacentre can be handled by IoT technology by intrusion detection methods. By 2025, more than 25 billion things will be connected to the internet network, therefore massive data will be generated by different heterogeneous sources, and powerful processing engines such as complex event processing (CEP) are needed to handle such a fast and continuous stream of big data. The integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can enhance CEP by introducing new features such as automated rule extraction and self-healing mechanism. This study aims to provide an overview of CEP, as well as its features and potential for integration with IoT applications and ML/DL techniques. We provide a review of recent research works to highlight the capability and applicability of CEP technology to monitor physical facilities and cyber security in detail.

The Internet of Things (IoT) was established out of the interconnectedness of numerous new technologies, such as wireless technology, the Internet, embedded automation systems, and micro-electromechanical devices. Manufacturing settings and activities have been successfully altered into the fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, by applying cutting-edge technologies such as cloud computing (CC), cloud service provider (CSP), Information communication technologies (ICT), and Enterprise Model, as well as other technological advancements. Data management is characterized as acquiring data to make better business decisions; data about a corporation is processed, secured, and stored. In the early notion, there were connected contrivances and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions, and transaction data is recorded on the Blockchain. Security is a challenging subject that must be carefully considered throughout a CSP's design and development phases. By focusing on such issues while taking into account the traditional characteristics of IoT/ IIoT-predicated environments, we proposed a Secure and Distributed Framework for Resource Management (SDFRM) in Industry 4.0 environments within a distributed and collaborative Industry 4.0 system, the dynamic and trust-based Distributed Management Framework (DMF) of shared resource access, in this research article. Furthermore, to offer strong privacy assurances for Access Control (AC)-equivalent actions, a privacy-preserving approach is devised and implemented into the Distributed Management Framework (DMF). Based on blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks, the recommended DMF provides for dynamic access control and system governance without relying on third-party vulnerabilities. A privacy-preserving technique is presented and implemented into the DMF to give adequate privacy safeguards for AC-related processes.

Furthermore, in the process of backstepping design, based on the Nussbaum gain function formula, fuzzy logic system approximation method, and inverse optimal control theory, combing the available output signal, an output feedback inverse optimal controller is proposed. Specifically, the designed controller not only ensures that the system is secure under network attacks but also optimal in terms of the cost function.

The input parameters of the model are the flow intensities of typed cyber-physical attacks, the flow intensities of possible cyber-immune reactions, and the set of probabilities of neutralization of cyber-physical attacks. The set of admissible states of the info-communication system is described taking into account possible variants of the development of the modeled process. The initial parameters of the model are the probabilities of the studied system in the appropriate states at a particular moment. The dynamics of the info-communication system's life cycle are embodied in the form of a matrix of transient probabilities. The mentioned matrix connects the initial parameters in the form of a system of Chapman's equations. The article presents a computationally efficient concept based on Gershgorin's theorems to solve such a system of equations with given initiating values. Based on the presented scientific results, the article proposes the concept of calculating the time to failure as an indicator of the reliability of the info-communication system operating under the probable impact of typical cyber-physical attacks. The adequacy of the model and concepts presented in the article is proved by comparing a statically representative amount of empirical and simulated data. We emphasize that the main contribution of the research is the description of the process of the security subsystem countering the impact of typed cyber-physical attacks as a model of end states in continuous time. Based on the created model, the concept of computationally efficient solution of Chapman's equation system based on Gershgorin's theorems and calculating time to failure as an indicator of the reliability of the info-communication system operating under the probable impact of typed cyber-physical attacks are formalized.

Risk management aims to identify potential risks, evaluate their attributes, and implement countermeasures to reduce their damages. The cyber security industry and the research literature have established frameworks and platforms for cyber risk management. However, a risk management framework is required to ensure a practical and secure service for multiple collaborating organizations.

Social botnets and the challenges of cyber situation awareness,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00530-6,14 August 2024,Shashank Yadav,"As security communities brace for the emerging social automation based threats, we examine the mechanisms of developing situation awareness in cyberspace and the governance issues that social botnets bring into these. We point out that an organisation’s situation awareness in cyberspace is a phenomena fundamentally distinct from the original conception of situation awareness, requiring continuous data exchange and knowledge management where the standard orchestration mechanisms require significant policy attention in light of the AI-driven automation of social engineering operations. We conceptualise cyber situation awareness as a socio-technical phenomena with Syntactic, Semantic, and Operatic dimensions—each subject to a number of stressors which are exacerbated under the growing threat of Malicious Social Automation in cyber security environments. The article further contributes to the ideas of developing situational awareness in cyberspace as being essentially a knowledge management exercise and characterises the threat data governance challenges therein to address the increasingly social and often pervasive automation in our digital societies.",security community brace emerge social automation base threat examine mechanism develop situation awareness cyberspace governance issue social botnets bring point organisation situation awareness cyberspace phenomenon fundamentally distinct original conception situation awareness require continuous data exchange knowledge management standard orchestration mechanism require significant policy attention light aidriven automation social engineering operation conceptualise cyber situation awareness sociotechnical phenomenon syntactic semantic operatic dimensionseach subject number stressor exacerbate grow threat malicious social automation cyber security environment article contributes idea develop situational awareness cyberspace essentially knowledge management exercise characterises threat data governance challenge therein address increasingly social often pervasive automation digital society,0.0,0.09008616617126326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5733517675284344,0.084506356526191,0.0,0.0858256051314259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10493536664562338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12805497362850424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10458504203683397,0.0,0.0,0.10040354459602227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858256051314259,0.2353590745749457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20917008407366794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048723740906097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846997290432866,0.0,0.09162085793046171,0.0,0.6226693326447882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2201049717195232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Cyber-XAI-Block: an end-to-end cyber threat detection & fl-based risk assessment framework for iot enabled smart organization using xai and blockchain technologies,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-20059-4,11 September 2024,"Omar Abboosh Hussein Gwassi, Osman Nuri Uçan, Enrique A. Navarro","The growing integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart organizations is increasing the vulnerability of cyber threats, necessitating advanced frameworks for effective threat detection and risk assessment. Existing works provide achievable results but lack effective solutions, such as detecting Social Engineering Attacks (SEA). Using Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) methods whereas they are limited to validating user behaviors. Like high false positive rates, attack reoccurrence, and increases in numerous attacks. To overcome this problem, we use explainable (DL) techniques to increase cyber security in an IoT-enabled smart organization environment. This paper firstly, implements Capsule Network (CapsNet) to process employee fingerprints and blink patterns. Secondly, the Quantum Key Secure Communication Protocol (QKSCP) was also used to decrease communication channel vulnerabilities like Man In The Middle (MITM) and reply attacks. After Dual Q Network-based Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm DQN-A3C algorithm detects and prevents attacks. Thirdly, employed the explainable DQN-A3C model and the Siamese Inter Lingual Transformer (SILT) transformer for natural language explanations to boost social engineering security by ensuring the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model and human trustworthiness. After, we built a Hopping Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS/IPS) using an explainable Harmonized Google Net (HGN) model with SHAP and SILT explanations to appropriately categorize dangerous external traffic flows. Finally, to improve global, cyberattack comprehension, we created a Federated Learning (FL)-based knowledge-sharing mechanism between Cyber Threat Repository (CTR) and cloud servers, known as global risk assessment. To evaluate the suggested approach, the new method is compared to the ones that already exist in terms of malicious traffic (65 bytes/sec), detection rate (97%), false positive rate (45%), prevention accuracy (98%), end-to-end response time (97 s), recall (96%), false negative rate (42%) and resource consumption (41). Our strategy's performance is examined using numerical analysis, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms other methods in all metrics.",grow integration internet thing iot smart organization increase vulnerability cyber threat necessitate advanced framework effective threat detection risk assessment exist work provide achievable result lack effective solution detect social engineering attack sea use deep learn dl machine learn ml method whereas limited validate user behavior like high false positive rate attack reoccurrence increase numerous attack overcome problem use explainable dl technique increase cyber security iotenabled smart organization environment paper firstly implement capsule network capsnet process employee fingerprint blink pattern secondly quantum key secure communication protocol qkscp also use decrease communication channel vulnerability like man middle mitm reply attack dual q networkbased asynchronous advantage actorcritic algorithm dqnac algorithm detects prevents attack thirdly employ explainable dqnac model siamese inter lingual transformer silt transformer natural language explanation boost social engineering security ensure artificial intelligence ai model human trustworthiness built hop intrusion detection prevention system idsips use explainable harmonize google net hgn model shap silt explanation appropriately categorize dangerous external traffic flow finally improve global cyberattack comprehension create federate learn flbased knowledgesharing mechanism cyber threat repository ctr cloud server know global risk assessment evaluate suggest approach new method compare one already exist term malicious traffic bytessec detection rate false positive rate prevention accuracy endtoend response time recall false negative rate resource consumption strategy performance examine use numerical analysis result demonstrate outperforms method metric,0.08645823926062897,0.0,0.10933697246608674,0.0,0.18764709250979644,0.0790929322663597,0.0,0.06705714427650475,0.0,0.2186739449321735,0.2878080603012186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10933697246608674,0.16369022389148447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13819512250087454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24132103579710443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08815127882052988,0.18764709250979644,0.0,0.0,0.08044034526570149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09382354625489822,0.08331233282594389,0.0,0.222582083916064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08815127882052988,0.08044034526570149,0.09382354625489822,0.0,0.0,0.222582083916064,0.0,0.08484782060729018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20117143282951425,0.1813007988614583,0.0,0.06615278537823051,0.07779837281704212,0.18764709250979644,0.06119241545172125,0.08331233282594389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09182250724454041,0.08645823926062897,0.0,0.06276447612870671,0.0,0.0,0.12715901211034236,0.1418896260988809,0.08645823926062897,0.0743638031999708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2186739449321735,0.09595377147689,0.08645823926062897,0.0,0.08815127882052988,0.0,0.07419402797202133,0.0,0.1932455154835362,0.09182250724454041,0.25239562335323407,0.0,0.2429294320631784,0.09823102159648692,0.0,0.17987175496392507,0.0790929322663597

These texts include not only security concepts, incidents, tools, guidelines, and policies, but also risk management approaches, best practices, assurances, technologies, and more. Through the integration of large-scale, heterogeneous, unstructured cyber security information, the identification and classification of cyber security entities can help handle cyber security issues. Due to the complexity and diversity of texts in the cyber security domain, it is difficult to identify security entities in the cyber security domain using the traditional named entity recognition (NER) methods. This paper describes various approaches and techniques for NER in this domain, including the rule-based approach, dictionary-based approach, and machine learning based approach, and discusses the problems faced by NER research in this domain, such as conjunction and disjunction, non-standardized naming convention, abbreviation, and massive nesting. Three future directions of NER in cyber security are proposed: (1) application of unsupervised or semi-supervised technology; (2) development of a more comprehensive cyber security ontology; (3) development of a more comprehensive deep learning model.",rapid development internet technology advent era big data cyber security text provide internet text include security concept incident tool guideline policy also risk management approach best practice assurance technology integration largescale heterogeneous unstructured cyber security information identification classification cyber security entity help handle cyber security issue due complexity diversity text cyber security domain difficult identify security entity cyber security domain use traditional name entity recognition ner method paper describes various approach technique ner domain include rulebased approach dictionarybased approach machine learn base approach discus problem face ner research domain conjunction disjunction nonstandardized name convention abbreviation massive nest three future direction ner cyber security propose application unsupervised semisupervised technology development comprehensive cyber security ontology development comprehensive deep learn model,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869484299234647,0.37471949597872134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292016925644159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41186290456363817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0628256886457636,0.0,0.0,0.27933270080772726,0.0,0.0,0.41943345297977536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09147111594901673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16333914487492476,0.0,0.0,0.07393317643323637,0.0,0.0,0.1798022624406881,0.0,0.08421465551918206,0.0,0.16584033851288318,0.0,0.09482698052799918,0.0,0.1026219771372886,0.0,0.07494389919574426,0.0675413432358255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838940525483617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026219771372886,0.0,0.06925742349458228,0.0701463598370323,0.0,0.07393317643323637,0.0,0.07928880621152692,0.0,0.415549560823116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292016925644159,0.2279492902089012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0543001914699825,0.0,0.09662680446206218,0.0,0.0

Audio Transmission Based on Hybrid Crypto-steganography Framework for Efficient Cyber Security in Wireless Communication System,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-023-17921-2,12 July 2024,Mai Helmy,"Wireless systems enable people in last decades to communicate and access applications and information without wires, which provided better image, audio and video transmitting with progressive needing for information security research. In a digital world, Cryptography and steganography are both intended to protect information from unwanted hackers. Both are excellent suggestion which are applied within different multiple layers of data security.

Enhancing IoT cyber attacks intrusion detection through GAN-based data augmentation and hybrid deep learning models for MQTT network protocol cyber attacks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-024-04752-5,04 November 2024,"Hayette Zeghida, Mehdi Boulaiche, Ramdane Chikh, Alwi M. Bamhdi, Ana Luiza Bessa Barros, Djamel Zeghida, Ahmed Patel","In the evolving digital landscape, interconnected IoT networks are expanding fast. However, essential security measures are often lacking, which makes it vulnerable to cyber threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are crucial in combating these threats, but IDSs in the IoT domain face significant challenges; one of them is the existence of imbalanced data, where attack activities are underrepresented compared to normal activities. This becomes a problem when handling Machine Learning (ML) tasks to improve the system’s intrusion detection ability. This paper presents a novel solution by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create balanced datasets. Unlike traditional methods, our approach generates high-quality synthetic samples that maintain the intricate characteristics of the data, making it possible to improve detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce three specialized IDSs designed to detect attacks on the lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, utilizing hybrid Deep Learning (DL) algorithms (CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-GRU). Experimental results, using a combination of both the original MQTT dataset and a newly generated dataset through GANs, demonstrate the better performance of the generated datasets in multi-class classification. This performance highlights the effectiveness of our GAN-based approach in improving detection accuracy at the same time that it reduces false positives. The ultimate objective is to develop an autonomous system tailored to safeguard IoT environments, providing a robust and adaptable solution to emerging cyber threats.",evolve digital landscape interconnect iot network expand fast however essential security measure often lack make vulnerable cyber threat intrusion detection system id crucial combat threat id iot domain face significant challenge one existence imbalanced data attack activity underrepresented compare normal activity becomes problem handle machine learn ml task improve system intrusion detection ability paper present novel solution leverage generative adversarial network gans create balance datasets unlike traditional method approach generates highquality synthetic sample maintain intricate characteristic data make possible improve detection accuracy additionally introduce three specialized id design detect attack lightweight message queue telemetry transport mqtt protocol utilize hybrid deep learn dl algorithm cnnrnn cnnlstm cnngru experimental result use combination original mqtt dataset newly generate dataset gans demonstrate well performance generate datasets multiclass classification performance highlight effectiveness ganbased approach improve detection accuracy time reduces false positive ultimate objective develop autonomous system tailor safeguard iot environment provide robust adaptable solution emerge cyber threat,0.22277900902571424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12087868569087738,0.0,0.0,0.17278774443903006,0.0,0.0,0.14832037990094973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708102014990758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11869689037626775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.144848468660231,0.10931470241894775,0.4145451158207848,0.0,0.0,0.11830062319757657,0.12087868569087738,0.0,0.113570752237895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32200931522502363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626360570726322,0.0,0.0,0.19117752302827537,0.0,0.10931470241894775,0.19725510897711043,0.0,0.10931470241894775,0.08639387221951503,0.0,0.0,0.17045746127707734,0.0,0.0,0.07883797883698129,0.21467287681668243,0.0,0.0,0.09708102014990758,0.11830062319757657,0.0,0.0,0.08086336197421687,0.0,0.0,0.08191341550813576,0.0,0.0,0.0479037467277477,0.0,0.1036362789551962,0.0,0.0,0.24724637356379456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24897016644248232,0.11830062319757657,0.0,0.0,0.06259620667854524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An intelligent dynamic cyber physical system threat detection system for ensuring secured communication in 6G autonomous vehicle networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-70835-3,05 September 2024,"Shanthalakshmi M, Ponmagal R S","Smart cities have developed advanced technology that improves people’s lives. A collaboration of smart cities with autonomous vehicles shows the development towards a more advanced future. Cyber-physical system (CPS) are used blend the cyber and physical world, combined with electronic and mechanical systems, Autonomous vehicles (AVs) provide an ideal model of CPS. The integration of 6G technology with Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) marks a significant advancement in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), offering enhanced self-sufficiency, intelligence, and effectiveness. Autonomous vehicles rely on a complex network of sensors, cameras, and software to operate. A cyber-attack could interfere with these systems, leading to accidents, injuries, or fatalities. Autonomous vehicles are often connected to broader transportation networks and infrastructure. A successful cyber-attack could disrupt not only individual vehicles but also public transportation systems, causing widespread chaos and economic damage. Autonomous vehicles communicate with other vehicles (V2V) and infrastructure (V2I) for safe and efficient operation. If these communication channels are compromised, it could lead to collisions, traffic jams, or other dangerous situations. So we present a novel approach to mitigating these security risks by leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for dynamic cyber-attack detection within the cyber-physical systems (CPS) framework of AVs. The proposed Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IIDS) employs a combination of advanced learning techniques, including Data Fusion, One-Class Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor, to improve detection accuracy. The study demonstrates that the EfficientNet model achieves superior performance with an accuracy of up to 99.97%, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance the security of AV networks. This research contributes to the development of intelligent cyber-security models that align with 6G standards, ultimately supporting the safe and efficient integration of AVs into smart cities.",smart city developed advanced technology improves people life collaboration smart city autonomous vehicle show development towards advanced future cyberphysical system cps use blend cyber physical world combine electronic mechanical system autonomous vehicle av provide ideal model cps integration g technology autonomous vehicle av mark significant advancement intelligent transportation system offering enhance selfsufficiency intelligence effectiveness autonomous vehicle rely complex network sensor camera software operate cyberattack could interfere system lead accident injury fatality autonomous vehicle often connect broader transportation network infrastructure successful cyberattack could disrupt individual vehicle also public transportation system cause widespread chaos economic damage autonomous vehicle communicate vehicle vv infrastructure vi safe efficient operation communication channel compromise could lead collision traffic jam dangerous situation present novel approach mitigate security risk leverage pretrained convolutional neural network cnn model dynamic cyberattack detection within cyberphysical system cps framework av propose intelligent intrusion detection system iids employ combination advanced learn technique include data fusion oneclass support vector machine random forest knearest neighbor improve detection accuracy study demonstrates efficientnet model achieves superior performance accuracy highlight potential significantly enhance security av network research contributes development intelligent cybersecurity model align g standard ultimately support safe efficient integration av smart city,0.21746205929581047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433195499682972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10292949948566744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3706099110816176,0.057932006983326026,0.0,0.20954939189142016,0.09190013838774891,0.07069572312592234,0.0,0.3034885387709581,0.20954939189142016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22620910729915095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10116284625698603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477469594571008,0.09190013838774891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309544085776351,0.11086021867785686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09330739469265334,0.0,0.10670574576704953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30400838917185724,0.0,0.3327784849547521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477469594571008,0.12353663702720585,0.11547720428881755,0.0947640383744601,0.0,0.0,0.07793314711430377,0.0789334385380358,0.0,0.08319462123868802,0.0,0.0892211388643966,0.0,0.09352090627352193,0.0,0.10116284625698603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07415690083292167,0.0,0.25322573055874426,0.09330739469265334,0.17100266101044592,0.0,0.0,0.15870804356247756,0.0,0.06110225585414745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Retaliating against cyber-attacks: a decision-taking framework for policy-makers and enforcers of international and cybersecurity law,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-024-00113-5,27 March 2024,"Sozon Leventopoulos, Kosmas Pipyros, Dimitris Gritzalis","Cyber warfare is a reality taking on increasing importance. Governments, state-sponsored actors, and non-state sponsored actors have used cyber-attacks as the “weapon of choice” due to their specific characteristics. Cyber-attacks can be highly targeted and focused, even tailored to a specific unit or system, providing limited to no physical destruction (unlike a cruise missile) and potentially resulting in no loss of life. There are several incident response frameworks and approaches that an organization can implement to enhance its security posture. Usually, these will address specific adverse events such as computer security incidents, which in turn are limited in scope and coverage, typically within an organization. Nations have made limited effort in confronting severe cyber-attacks targeting and/or threatening them, as well as in preventing these attacks from being launched. In this work, we identify and discuss a decision-taking framework that may allow state actors to adopt new options against severe cyber-attacks, not always complying with international norms. Such options are neither encouraged nor supported. On the contrary, we discuss them so that the international community is made aware of such potential frameworks. More specifically, by defining clear thresholds, roles, and responsibilities, by introducing a structured chain of command, and by identifying the potential of certain actions, policy makers can recognize an extended decision space that may lead to unpredictable deterrence options against cyber-attacks.",cyber warfare reality take increase importance government statesponsored actor nonstate sponsor actor use cyberattacks weapon choice due specific characteristic cyberattacks highly target focus even tailor specific unit system provide limited physical destruction unlike cruise missile potentially result loss life several incident response framework approach organization implement enhance security posture usually address specific adverse event computer security incident turn limited scope coverage typically within organization nation make limited effort confront severe cyberattacks target andor threaten well prevent attack launch work identify discus decisiontaking framework may allow state actor adopt new option severe cyberattacks always comply international norm option neither encourage support contrary discus international community make aware potential framework specifically define clear threshold role responsibility introduce structure chain command identify potential certain action policy maker recognize extend decision space may lead unpredictable deterrence option cyberattacks,0.0,0.11853171943370043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10049442325188004,0.0,0.0,0.08626405236689225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06903484722762677,0.6242753794128841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13478137541816393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321069070203263,0.36165301359952834,0.0,0.24531248414211881,0.0,0.14060758581447222,0.0,0.0,0.11119003247495252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2294495882737357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11659164270320321,0.28121517162894444,0.0,0.0,0.14721279838695317,0.2752175031203891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09406126516888919,0.0,0.0,0.09528270045780243,0.0,0.0,0.11144446418091489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508785948694871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07281268365807712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11853171943370043
A Tullock-contest-based approach for cyber security investments,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-022-04958-z,14 September 2022,"David Iliaev, Sigal Oren, Ella Segev","We study a cyber security game between a defender who wishes to defend her information assets and an attacker who tries to attack them. In this game the attacker and the defender choose how to distribute their resources in attacking or defending the different information assets. Given these investments the probability that an attack on a given asset is successful is an increasing function of the attacker’s investment and a decreasing function of the defender’s investment. The defender tries to minimize the expected damage from the attacks plus the cost of the defense while the attacker tries to maximize the expected damage from attacks minus his attacks’ expenses. The attacker is constrained by a budget. We compare two scenarios: a sequential move game and a simultaneous game. In the sequential game the defender moves first by deciding how much resources to allocate to the defense of each information asset and the attacker observes these investments and responds by allocating his resources in a manner that maximizes his expected utility. In the simultaneous game the attacker does not observe the defender’s decision before making his own. We analyze the best response strategies of the players and the equilibria of each of these games. Based on this analysis, we provide a tight upper bound on the reduction in defender’s costs that can be achieved by moving from the simultaneous to the sequential game.",study cyber security game defender wish defend information asset attacker try attack game attacker defender choose distribute resource attack defend different information asset give investment probability attack give asset successful increase function attacker investment decrease function defender investment defender try minimize expect damage attack plus cost defense attacker try maximize expect damage attack minus attack expense attacker constrain budget compare two scenario sequential move game simultaneous game sequential game defender move first decide much resource allocate defense information asset attacker observes investment responds allocate resource manner maximizes expect utility simultaneous game attacker observe defender decision make analyze best response strategy player equilibrium game base analysis provide tight upper bound reduction defender cost achieve move simultaneous sequential game,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17378726457784105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7588649062309726,0.0,0.16302312734906096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10121659685320794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18305835948350085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16302312734906096,0.0,0.43606342383556235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16820567732887876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379094984408418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169808332687471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18997071509146563,0.1295641136280589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Aruna Sri, Papiya Dutta, Ali Rizwan, Prashanth Venkatareddy","As a result of recent advancements in electronics technology, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) may now make use of a vast array of tiny sensors (WSN). WSN are viewed as problematic networks because of the environments in which they may operate and the technology they rely on. For instance, routing protocols need to be prepared for and capable of recovering from unexpected events like node failures and packet losses. The dynamic nature of these routing environments necessitates that every WSN routing protocol have mechanisms for adapting to new conditions. In many applications, security affects performance and energy efficiency. To provide such security services, we require resilient key management techniques. Security Power Aware Routing-Salp Swarm Optimization (SPAR-SSO) protocol uses a unique cryptosystem. SPAR-SSO uses connection quality estimation and power aware routing to reduce power consumption and delay while increasing packet delivery ratio. WSNs must conserve energy because the nodes are battery-powered. If the route with the greatest energy savings is constantly chosen for delivery, the nodes along this route will be overused and drained quickly, leading to network partitioning. In SPAR-SSO, an optimal path to the sink node is chosen. This technology is interesting because to its ease in enterprise and tractability in network transportation administration to deliver integrated services. It delivers a collision-free medium and minimizes entire energy expended in attainment the terminus, dropping energy each unit or packet. Moreover, Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) is applied to optimize the results. The Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and End to End Delay is used as parameters to compare the performance of SPAR-SSO protocol. The results are compared with existing results and presented the success of the proposed method. Results show the proposed algorithm is suitable and compatibility with cyber-physical systems.",result recent advancement electronics technology wireless sensor network wsns may make use vast array tiny sensor wsn wsn view problematic network environment may operate technology rely instance rout protocol need prepared capable recover unexpected event like node failure packet loss dynamic nature rout environment necessitates every wsn rout protocol mechanism adapt new condition many application security affect performance energy efficiency provide security service require resilient key management technique security power aware routingsalp swarm optimization sparsso protocol us unique cryptosystem sparsso us connection quality estimation power aware rout reduce power consumption delay increase packet delivery ratio wsns must conserve energy node batterypowered route great energy saving constantly chosen delivery node along route overuse drain quickly lead network partition sparsso optimal path sink node chosen technology interest ease enterprise tractability network transportation administration deliver integrate service delivers collisionfree medium minimizes entire energy expend attainment terminus drop energy unit packet moreover salp swarm optimization sso apply optimize result packet delivery ratio pdr end end delay use parameter compare performance sparsso protocol result compare exist result present success propose method result show propose algorithm suitable compatibility cyberphysical system,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14220000482909345,0.0,0.11791207465366342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12626909345322007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26720610708776515,0.14220000482909345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244928972571772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11602408352139017,0.13916720796418885,0.0,0.10163254982963696,0.0,0.12859629572427106,0.4010475739079732,0.11791207465366342,0.0,0.0,0.25253818690644014,0.0,0.0,0.11420476203251788,0.0,0.0,0.18784206906557926,0.09512653448794219,0.1363078110211184,0.0,0.48180901431258344,0.0,0.0,0.16905990440955335,0.2844000096581869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244928972571772,0.3091254637722677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472746140661228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Then, based on the robust optimal allocation strategy, it can be proved that the topology of the networked cyber-physical system has a great influence on the loss function.

Cyber-Security Attacks on Microgrid and Its Mitigation via Adaptive Fuzzy PID Controller,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40815-024-01841-w,16 September 2024,"Rajendra Kumar Khadanga, Sidhartha Panda, Deepa Das","Cyberattacks on frequency stability problems pose a significant threat to microgrids. Furthermore, frequency fluctuations brought on by cyberattacks in any region of the microgrid impact the system, endangering the stability of the network. This problem can be fixed using a self-adaptive virtual inertia control strategy, which enhances the microgrid’s stability and damping capabilities. When using this control method, the evaluation of the microgrid’s frequency data is obtained through the usage of a phase-locked loop (PLL). However, because of its system dynamics, PLL implementation in microgrids produces more frequency oscillation. Once more, this work addresses the above problem by presenting a robust adaptive fuzzy PID controller (AFPID) for virtual inertia control.

Using the 2016 Enterprise ICT Survey of Kenya which provides a rich source of information on the use of ICT among firms, we examine the effect of cybersecurity breach on labour productivity and show how this effect is moderated by cyber risk mitigation capabilities at the firm level. We find that cybersecurity breach reduces labour productivity at the firm level. We also find that upskilling mitigates the negative effect of cybersecurity breach on labour productivity especially for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. The results further suggest that while Information Technology Policy and Information Technology Security capabilities can enable firms to improve labour productivity, these measures are not sufficient to offset the adverse effect of cybersecurity breach on labour productivity. Together the results imply that upskilling is an effective cyber risk mitigation measure against cybersecurity breaches at the firm level and therefore should be an integral part of the overarching IT governance strategy of firms.",scholarly work focus positive effect digitalisation subsaharan africa without accounting associate risk mitigation measure firm level use enterprise ict survey kenya provide rich source information use ict among firm examine effect cybersecurity breach labour productivity show effect moderate cyber risk mitigation capability firm level find cybersecurity breach reduces labour productivity firm level also find upskilling mitigates negative effect cybersecurity breach labour productivity especially small mediumsized enterprise result suggest information technology policy information technology security capability enable firm improve labour productivity measure sufficient offset adverse effect cybersecurity breach labour productivity together result imply upskilling effective cyber risk mitigation measure cybersecurity breach firm level therefore integral part overarch governance strategy firm,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12545762159189008,0.0,0.0,0.4975476160100483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12003950914805889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11345010160053287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702495525361662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5483859361356603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3466231304046479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08546917307648111,0.0,0.0,0.17315807100829783,0.28982610288821814,0.0,0.05063224580485834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11773402203025407,0.0,0.12003950914805889,0.0,0.0,0.18516178062352948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13232311622773285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10770435657166359

In the process of defense and attack, there will be a period of delay in establishing the decision-making and strategy. Recently, fuzzy-based decision-making has been effectively utilized for uncertainty and vague data in security applications. Fuzzy decision tree blends fuzzy representation and associates approximate reasoning with symbolic decision trees. They provide for handling language-related uncertainty, noise, missing or faulty features, and robust behavior while also providing comprehensible knowledge interpretation. Cyber threat intelligence is information an organization utilizes to understand the dangers that have, might, and is presently attacking the company. The collection of single or multi-criteria techniques using fuzzy logic aiming at selecting the best alternative in case of inaccurate, incomplete, and vague information. Hence, this paper proposes a fuzzy multimode decision support system (FMMDSS) for security defense automation. Fuzzy logic is a progression to define the human inclination of accurate thinking that simplifies classical logic. This paper aims at the state explosion problem when network nodes increase and design the attack-defense graph to compress the state space and extract network states and defense policies. A simple example representing the suggested model to support decision-making accompanies the security attack and defense processes. This research will potentially offer new ideas and stimuli for future designs of network security and defense automation architecture. This paper concludes with a policy for implementing the recommended model in an operational setting with better dependability predictions, general comparison of predictive analysis ratio 89.7% and a cognitive ability ratio 92.5%, the security control selection ratio of 82.5%.

The proposed system gives university network administrators complete access into traffic patterns, security concerns, and performance metrics for efficient network administration and improved security. The research begins with university network issues, including rising bandwidth demand, diversified traffic, and changing security threats. The paper then discusses the PRTG Tool, a popular network-monitoring tool with strong scalability, and Sophos Firewall, a sophisticated network security solution. The integration of the two tools underpins the proposed real-time monitoring system. It also describes the system design, which uses PRTG Network Monitor sensors strategically distributed throughout the network infrastructure to collect real-time network traffic statistics. These sensors collect traffic data using SNMP and flow technologies such as NetFlow or sFlow. The monitoring system and Sophos Firewall enable real-time threat detection and prevention to improve security. The research paper also discusses the data visualization features of the PRTG Network Monitor. It shows how graphs, charts, and dashboards help network managers understand traffic patterns and spot anomalies and make informed network optimization and security decisions.

Currently, a comprehensive, efficient methodology dedicated to MID cyber-security risk assessment is lacking. We propose theThreat identification, ontology-based Likelihood, severity Decomposition, and Risk assessment(TLDR) methodology and demonstrate its feasibility and consistency with existing methodologies, while being more efficient, providing details regarding the severity components, and supporting organizational prioritization and customization. Using our methodology, the impact of 23 MIDs attacks (that were previously identified) was decomposed into six severity aspects. FourRadiology Medical Experts(RMEs) were asked to assess these six aspects for each attack. The TLDR methodology’sexternal consistencywas demonstrated by calculating pairedT-tests between TLDR severity assessments and those of existing methodologies (and between the respective overall risk assessments, using attack likelihood estimates by four healthcare cyber-security experts); the differences were insignificant, implyingexternally consistentrisk assessment. The TLDR methodology’sinternal consistencywas evaluated by calculating the pairwise Spearman rank correlations between the severity assessments of different groups of two to four RMEs and each of their individual group members, showing that the correlations between the severity rankings, using the TLDR methodology, were significant (P< 0.05), demonstrating that the severity rankings wereinternally consistentfor all groups of RMEs. Using existing methodologies, however, the internal correlations were insignificant for groups of less than four RMEs. Furthermore, compared to standard risk assessment techniques, the TLDR methodology is also sensitive to local radiologists’ preferences, supports a greater level of flexibility regarding risk prioritization, and produces more transparent risk assessments.",medical image device mids expose cybersecurity threat currently comprehensive efficient methodology dedicate mid cybersecurity risk assessment lack propose thethreat identification ontologybased likelihood severity decomposition risk assessmenttldr methodology demonstrate feasibility consistency exist methodology efficient provide detail regard severity component support organizational prioritization customization use methodology impact mids attack previously identify decompose six severity aspect fourradiology medical expertsrmes ask ass six aspect attack tldr methodologysexternal consistencywas demonstrate calculate pairedttests tldr severity assessment exist methodology respective overall risk assessment use attack likelihood estimate four healthcare cybersecurity expert difference insignificant implyingexternally consistentrisk assessment tldr methodologysinternal consistencywas evaluate calculate pairwise spearman rank correlation severity assessment different group two four rmes individual group member show correlation severity ranking use tldr methodology significant p demonstrate severity ranking wereinternally consistentfor group rmes use exist methodology however internal correlation insignificant group less four rmes furthermore compare standard risk assessment technique tldr methodology also sensitive local radiologist preference support great level flexibility regard risk prioritization produce transparent risk assessment,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7393219469444091,0.1668102438770381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21176726153228395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08047811761604685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27189524532092946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11698970321434012,0.07906081035119954,0.08047811761604685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725215589208502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05986095137802612,0.060629281652075706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4111879825117576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0777038326473629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19450431178417005,0.07167000979333045,0.0,0.06222382207745457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18773214234031685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Accessible and Inclusive Cyber Security: A Nuanced and Complex Challenge,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-022-01239-1,22 June 2022,"Karen Renaud, Lizzie Coles-Kemp","It has been argued that human-centred security design needs to accommodate the considerations of three dimensions: (1) security, (2) usability and (3) accessibility. The latter has not yet received much attention. Now that governments and health services are increasingly requiring their citizens/patients to use online services, the need for accessible security and privacy has become far more pressing. The reality is that, for many, security measures are often exasperatingly inaccessible. Regardless of the outcome of the debate about the social acceptability of compelling people to access public services online, we still need to design accessibility into these systems, or risk excluding and marginalising swathes of the population who cannot use these systems in the same way as abled users. These users are particularly vulnerable to attack and online deception not only because security and privacy controls are inaccessible but also because they often struggle with depleted resources and capabilities together with less social, economic and political resilience. This conceptual paper contemplates the accessible dimension of human-centred security and its impact on the inclusivity of security technologies. We scope the range of vulnerabilities that can result from a lack of accessibility in security solutions and contemplate the nuances and complex challenges inherent in making security accessible. We conclude by suggesting a number of avenues for future work in this space.",argue humancentred security design need accommodate consideration three dimension security usability accessibility latter yet receive much attention government health service increasingly require citizenspatients use online service need accessible security privacy become far press reality many security measure often exasperatingly inaccessible regardless outcome debate social acceptability compelling people access public service online still need design accessibility system risk exclude marginalise swathe population use system way abled user user particularly vulnerable attack online deception security privacy control inaccessible also often struggle deplete resource capability together less social economic political resilience conceptual paper contemplates accessible dimension humancentred security impact inclusivity security technology scope range vulnerability result lack accessibility security solution contemplate nuance complex challenge inherent make security accessible conclude suggest number avenue future work space,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08365665109184392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10951257050102908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12108122947587324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24662563366080217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12108122947587324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11125714375058793,0.0,0.12331281683040109,0.0,0.0,0.3699384504912032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08893344653992877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13070749851955252,0.0,0.09240270319536137,0.10310700586080851,0.0,0.48634183998238656,0.4090728208774354,0.0,0.0,0.31780781078406917,0.13945355062306997,0.0,0.0,0.12811386810832998,0.0,0.0,0.09880826783558196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412237219261998,0.2855263431987314,0.0,0.13070749851955252,0.11494900162825085
Event-triggered finite-time command-filtered tracking control for nonlinear time-delay cyber physical systems against cyber attacks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/FITEE.2300613,29 December 2023,"Yajing Ma

            (解相朋)","This article addresses the secure finite-time tracking problem via event-triggered command-filtered control for nonlinear time-delay cyber physical systems (CPSs) subject to cyber attacks. Under the attack circumstance, the output and state information of CPSs is unavailable for the feedback design, and the classical coordinate conversion of the iterative process is incompetent in relation to the tracking task. To solve this, a new coordinate conversion is proposed by considering the attack gains and the reference signal simultaneously.

Safe and secure system architectures for cyber-physical systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00287-023-01533-z,03 April 2023,Frank J. Furrer,"Cyber-physical systems are at the core of our current civilization. Countless examples dominate our daily life and work, such as driverless cars that will soon master our roads, implanted medical devices that will improve many lives, and industrial control systems that control production and infrastructure. Because cyber-physical systems manipulate the real world, they constitute a danger for many applications. Therefore, theirsafetyandsecurityare essential properties of these indispensable systems. The long history of systems engineering has demonstrated that the system quality properties—such as safety and security—strongly depend on the underlyingsystem architecture. Satisfactory system quality properties can only be ensured if the fundamental system architecture is sound! The development of dependable cyber-physical architectures in recent years suggests thattwoharmonical architectures are required: adesign-time architectureand arun-time architecture. The design-time architecture defines and specifies all parts and relationships, assuring the required system quality properties. However, in today’s complex systems, ensuring all quality properties in all operating conditions during design time will never be possible. Therefore, an additional line of defense against safety accidents and security incidents is indispensable: This must be provided by the run-time architecture. The run-time architecture primarily consists of aprotective shellthat monitors the run-time system during operation. It detects anomalies in system behavior, interface functioning, or data—often using artificial intelligence algorithms—and takes autonomous mitigation measures, thus attempting to prevent imminent safety accidents or security incidents before they occur.

Cyber threat assessment and management for securing healthcare ecosystems using natural language processing,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00769-w,27 October 2023,"Stefano Silvestri, Shareful Islam, Dmitry Amelin, Gabriele Weiler, Spyridon Papastergiou, Mario Ciampi","The healthcare sectors have constantly faced significant challenge due to the rapid rise of cyber threats. These threats can pose any potential risk within the system context and disrupt the critical healthcare service delivery. It is therefore necessary for the healthcare organisations to understand and tackle the threats to ensure overall security and resilience. However, threats are continuously evolved and there is large amount of unstructured security-related textual information is available. This makes the threat assessment and management task very challenging. There are a number of existing works that consider Machine Learning models for detection and prediction of cyber attack but they lack of focus on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the threat information from unstructured security-related text. To this end, this work proposes a novel method to assess and manage threats by adopting natural language processing. The proposed method has been tailored for the healthcare ecosystem and allows to identify and assess the possible threats within healthcare information infrastructure so that appropriate control and mitigation actions can be taken into consideration to tackle the threat. In detail, NLP techniques are used to extract the useful threat information related to specific assets of the healthcare ecosystems from the largely available security-related information on Internet (e.g. cyber security news), to evaluate the level of the identified threats and to select the required mitigation actions. We have performed experiments on real healthcare ecosystems in Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering, considering in particular three different healthcare scenarios, namely implantable medical devices, wearables, and biobank, with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of our approach, which is able to provide a realistic manner to identify and assess the threats, evaluate the threat level and suggest the required mitigation actions.",healthcare sector constantly face significant challenge due rapid rise cyber threat threat pose potential risk within system context disrupt critical healthcare service delivery therefore necessary healthcare organisation understand tackle threat ensure overall security resilience however threat continuously evolve large amount unstructured securityrelated textual information available make threat assessment management task challenge number exist work consider machine learn model detection prediction cyber attack lack focus natural language processing nlp extract threat information unstructured securityrelated text end work proposes novel method ass manage threat adopt natural language processing propose method tailor healthcare ecosystem allows identify ass possible threat within healthcare information infrastructure appropriate control mitigation action take consideration tackle threat detail nlp technique use extract useful threat information related specific asset healthcare ecosystem largely available securityrelated information internet eg cyber security news evaluate level identify threat select require mitigation action perform experiment real healthcare ecosystem fraunhofer institute biomedical engineering consider particular three different healthcare scenario namely implantable medical device wearable biobank purpose demonstrate feasibility approach able provide realistic manner identify ass threat evaluate threat level suggest require mitigation action,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045976036727457203,0.0,0.07496413269616496,0.03946566497465154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10332678541390695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05712099605765356,0.0,0.09474999414613948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05515189034975109,0.0,0.05712099605765356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06432774397204499,0.0,0.06043869711948089,0.0,0.6642867476572208,0.16834509939452016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22677992949058295,0.06295578213224562,0.0,0.05515189034975109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050869260714921705,0.13805342813342433,0.058173764459759136,0.052486408480262876,0.06295578213224562,0.0,0.09195207345491441,0.041434770682553995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06295578213224562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04248753908465958,0.04303287726918754,0.12332452420511353,0.0,0.0,0.04864151859694543,0.0,0.050985662810475174,0.06432774397204499,0.05515189034975109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06043869711948089,0.0,0.050869260714921705,0.0,0.5741402559011433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03331168546236569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10845614134017158

An adaptive predefined time sliding mode control for uncertain nonlinear cyber-physical servo system under cyber attacks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-57775-8,28 March 2024,"Saleem Riaz, Bingqiang Li, Rong Qi, Chenda Zhang","Malicious attacks are often inevitable in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Accuracy in Cyber physical system for position tracking of servos is the major concern now a days. In high precision industrial automation, it is very hard to achieve accuracy in tracking especially under malicious cyber-attacks, control saturations, parametric perturbations and external disturbances. In this paper, we have designed a novel predefined time (PDT) convergence sliding mode adaptive controller (PTCSMAC) for such kind of cyber physical control system. Main key feature of our control is to cope these challenges that are posed by CPS systems such as parameter perturbation, control saturation, and cyber-attacks and the whole system then upgrade to a third-order system to facilitate adaptive control law. Then, we present an adaptive controller based on the novel PDT convergent sliding mode surface (SMS) combined with a modified weight updated Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which is used to approximate the uncertain part of the system. Another significant advantage of our proposed control approach is that it does not require detailed model information, guaranteeing robust performance even when the system model is uncertain. Additionally, our proposed PTCSMAC controller is nonsingular regardless of initial conditions, and is capable of eradicating the possibility of singularity problems, which are frequently a concern in numerous CPS control systems. Finally, we have verified our designed PTCSMAC control law through rigorous simulations on CPS seeker servo positioning system and compared the robustness and performance of different existing techniques.",malicious attack often inevitable cyberphysical system cps accuracy cyber physical system position track servo major concern day high precision industrial automation hard achieve accuracy track especially malicious cyberattacks control saturation parametric perturbation external disturbance paper design novel predefined time pdt convergence slide mode adaptive controller ptcsmac kind cyber physical control system main key feature control cope challenge pose cps system parameter perturbation control saturation cyberattacks whole system upgrade thirdorder system facilitate adaptive control law present adaptive controller base novel pdt convergent slide mode surface sm combine modify weight update extreme learn machine elm use approximate uncertain part system another significant advantage propose control approach require detailed model information guarantee robust performance even system model uncertain additionally propose ptcsmac controller nonsingular regardless initial condition capable eradicate possibility singularity problem frequently concern numerous cps control system finally verify design ptcsmac control law rigorous simulation cps seeker servo position system compare robustness performance different exist technique,0.18160897947170757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07042810287653371,0.0,0.0,0.06045523082822927,0.0,0.07792375728515442,0.0,0.07914024338559637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7000035101948636,0.41267635651990436,0.09676145531831049,0.1750008775487159,0.08750043877435795,0.0,0.0,0.17822623086780162,0.0,0.0,0.08750043877435795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854005026868426,0.10077736178415823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06947828191096533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07792375728515442,0.0,0.08911311543390081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12694318605995647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06426855448730197,0.1750008775487159,0.20633817825995218,0.0,0.07914024338559637,0.09643841914791469,0.0,0.13016853937904221,0.0,0.09445694862091343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08448407657260898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07792375728515442,0.0,0.0,0.09643841914791469,0.0,0.0,0.05102829599344584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
A survey on cyber threat intelligence sharing based on Blockchain,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43674-023-00057-z,23 May 2023,"Ahmed El-Kosairy, Nashwa Abdelbaki, Heba Aslan","In recent years, cyber security attacks have increased massively. This introduces the need to defend against such attacks. Cyber security threat intelligence has recently been introduced to secure systems against security attacks. Cyber security threat intelligence (CTI) should be fast, trustful, and protect the sender's identity to stop these attacks at the right time. Threat intelligence sharing is vitally important since it is considered an effective way to improve threat understanding. This leads to protecting the assets and preventing the attack vectors. However, there is a paradox between the privacy safeguard needs of threat intelligence sharing; the need to produce complete proper threat intelligence feeds to be shared with the community, and other challenges and needs that are not covered in the traditional CTI. This paper aims to study how Blockchain technology can be incorporated with the CTI to solve the current issues and challenges in the traditional CTI.

An integrated approach of designing functionality with security for distributed cyber-physical systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-022-04481-9,09 April 2022,"Dipty Tripathi, Amit Biswas, Anil Kumar Tripathi, Lalit Kumar Singh, Amrita Chaturvedi","In this work, we propose a multi-tier architectural model to separate functionality and security concerns for distributed cyber-physical systems. On the line of distributed computing, such systems require the identification of leaders for distribution of work, aggregation of results, etc. Further, we propose a fault-tolerant leader election algorithm that can independently elect the functionality and security leaders. The proposed election algorithm identifies a list of potential leader capable nodes to reduce the leader election overhead. It keeps identifying the highest potential node as the leader, whenever needed, including the situation when one has failed. We also explain the proposed architecture and its management method through a case study. Further, we perform several experiments to evaluate the system performance. The experimental results show that the proposed architectural model improves the system performance in terms of latency, average response time, and the number of real-time tasks completed within the deadline.",work propose multitier architectural model separate functionality security concern distribute cyberphysical system line distribute compute system require identification leader distribution work aggregation result etc propose faulttolerant leader election algorithm independently elect functionality security leader propose election algorithm identifies list potential leader capable node reduce leader election overhead keep identify high potential node leader whenever need include situation one fail also explain propose architecture management method case study perform several experiment evaluate system performance experimental result show propose architectural model improves system performance term latency average response time number realtime task complete within deadline,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3241608243801515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834453337173298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1784839679818649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439222645481789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138763678649852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12623731245098782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15862361226560814,0.0,0.1158413854353523,0.20879839075805606,0.1465748235533278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878445290963578,0.0,0.3172472245312163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5352587719208847,0.0,0.15536445460450318,0.0,0.21966751331839737,0.0,0.0,0.12846365710722318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186456761734763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15862361226560814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27326647893324674
CyberDefender: an integrated intelligent defense framework for digital-twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-024-04320-x,20 March 2024,"S. Krishnaveni, Thomas M. Chen, Mithileysh Sathiyanarayanan, B. Amutha","The rise of digital twin-based operational improvements poses a challenge to protecting industrial cyber-physical systems. It is crucial to safeguard digital twins while disclosing internals, which can create an increased attack surface. However, leveraging digital twins to simulate attacks on physical infrastructure becomes essential for enhancing ICPS cybersecurity resilience. This paper introduces an integrated intelligent defense framework called CyberDefender to study various attacks on digital twin-based ICPS from a four-layer perspective (i.e., digital twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems infrastructure layer, honeynet and software-defined industrial network layer, intelligent security platform layer, and smart industrial application layer). To demonstrate its feasibility, we implemented a proof-of-concept (PoC) solution using open-source tools, including AWS for cloud infrastructure, T-Pot for Honeynet, Mininet for SDN support, ELK tools for data management, and Docker for containerization. This framework utilizes an integrated intelligent approach to enhance intrusion detection and classification capabilities for digital twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems (DT-ICPS). The proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) combines two strategies to improve security. First, we present an innovative approach to identifying essential features using explainable AI and ensemble-based filter feature selection (XAI-EFFS). By using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we analyze the impact of different variables on predictive outcomes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid GRU-LSTM deep-learning model for detecting and classifying intrusions. We optimize the hyperparameters of the GRU-LSTM model by using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates excellent performance, outperforming conventional state-of-the-art techniques with an accuracy rate of 98.96%, which is a remarkable improvement. Additionally, it effectively detects zero-day attacks, contributing to digital twin-based ICPS cybersecurity resilience.",rise digital twinbased operational improvement pose challenge protect industrial cyberphysical system crucial safeguard digital twin disclose internals create increase attack surface however leverage digital twin simulate attack physical infrastructure becomes essential enhance icps cybersecurity resilience paper introduces integrate intelligent defense framework call cyberdefender study various attack digital twinbased icps fourlayer perspective ie digital twinbased industrial cyberphysical system infrastructure layer honeynet softwaredefined industrial network layer intelligent security platform layer smart industrial application layer demonstrate feasibility implement proofofconcept poc solution use opensource tool include aws cloud infrastructure tpot honeynet mininet sdn support elk tool data management docker containerization framework utilizes integrate intelligent approach enhance intrusion detection classification capability digital twinbased industrial cyberphysical system dticps propose intrusion detection system id combine two strategy improve security first present innovative approach identify essential feature use explainable ai ensemblebased filter feature selection xaieffs use shapley additive explanation shap analyze impact different variable predictive outcome secondly propose hybrid grulstm deeplearning model detect classify intrusion optimize hyperparameters grulstm model use bayesian optimization algorithm propose method demonstrates excellent performance outperform conventional stateoftheart technique accuracy rate remarkable improvement additionally effectively detects zeroday attack contribute digital twinbased icps cybersecurity resilience,0.08453158004047504,0.0,0.10690047725282567,0.0,0.0917327565047783,0.0,0.07606469244623236,0.1311256488027121,0.0,0.0,0.22511557296286616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736731172393864,0.10690047725282567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24436733355413018,0.1428932279775278,0.05496150636382112,0.0,0.15729558090613432,0.0,0.08145577785137673,0.6284341643926453,0.0,0.17586344322741337,0.0,0.0,0.1876310224022291,0.0,0.15729558090613432,0.0,0.08002125292544175,0.08145577785137673,0.0917327565047783,0.08145577785137673,0.0714466139887639,0.07254066781461933,0.0,0.0,0.269328927596848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08977630919894933,0.0,0.06556282440135605,0.11817376127805217,0.0,0.06467861848589279,0.0,0.0,0.05982878680924858,0.08145577785137673,0.09604201445173705,0.0,0.0736731172393864,0.0,0.0,0.1817644535630258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07270665972462154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09381551120111455,0.08453158004047504,0.05765235571309111,0.0,0.098433589658583,0.07254066781461933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19001274054385658,0.0,0.08453158004047504,0.0,0.0
