Navigating digital divide: exploring the influence of ideological and political education on cyber security and digital literacy amid information warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-06106-1,23 May 2024,Baihang Huang,"This study investigates the intricate relationship between ideological and political education (IPE), cyber security, and digital literacy within the context of online information warfare, aiming to shed light on strategies for navigating the digital divide. Utilizing a quantitative research approach and convenience sampling, data were collected through a meticulously crafted online survey from a diverse range of participants, including students, professionals, and other individuals. Analysis of the data, conducted using SPSS software and Smart-PLS 3, revealed several significant findings. Firstly, there exists a pronounced disparity in access to diverse online information based on individuals’ levels of IPE. Additionally, media literacy skills exhibit significant variation across different levels of IPE. Furthermore, the study elucidates how IPE influences individuals’ propensity to engage in online echo chambers and their susceptibility to cyber security vulnerabilities. Finally, it underscores the role of IPE in shaping digital participation and civic engagement. Overall, this research contributes novel insights into the complex dynamics of online information warfare and highlights the pivotal role of ideological and political education in mitigating the digital divide. This study underscores the critical importance of IPE in shaping individuals’ digital literacy, cyber security awareness, and engagement with online information environments. By elucidating the impact of IPE on navigating the digital divide, this research contributes valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and stakeholders seeking to foster a more informed, resilient, and inclusive digital society.",study investigates intricate relationship ideological political education ipe cyber security digital literacy within context online information warfare aim shed light strategy navigate digital divide utilize quantitative research approach convenience sample data collect meticulously craft online survey diverse range participant include student professional individual analysis data conduct use spss software smartpls reveal several significant finding firstly exists pronounce disparity access diverse online information base individual level ipe additionally medium literacy skill exhibit significant variation across different level ipe furthermore study elucidates ipe influence individual propensity engage online echo chamber susceptibility cyber security vulnerability finally underscore role ipe shape digital participation civic engagement overall research contributes novel insight complex dynamic online information warfare highlight pivotal role ideological political education mitigate digital divide study underscore critical importance ipe shape individual digital literacy cyber security awareness engagement online information environment elucidate impact ipe navigate digital divide research contributes valuable insight policymakers educator stakeholder seek foster inform resilient inclusive digital society,0.0,0.0,0.07320375307846438,0.06161318787692525,0.05978516800918966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07791419256631228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360561648720005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179779673213177,0.1400464202885573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251500916851016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360561648720005,0.45976980628565883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08157430664431631,0.0,0.06796690241730262,0.07046045153386211,0.0,0.3747400157957396,0.2871911869285271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881845922250105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5447823452033836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15936640484688616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17674479529364032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15582838513262456,0.16480641793546444,0.0,0.0936850039489349,0.0,0.0,0.06796690241730262,0.18205182486503274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0483781535337717,0.0,0.0,0.12136788324335517,0.0
Retaliating against cyber-attacks: a decision-taking framework for policy-makers and enforcers of international and cybersecurity law,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-024-00113-5,27 March 2024,"Sozon Leventopoulos, Kosmas Pipyros, Dimitris Gritzalis","Cyber warfare is a reality taking on increasing importance. Governments, state-sponsored actors, and non-state sponsored actors have used cyber-attacks as the “weapon of choice” due to their specific characteristics. Cyber-attacks can be highly targeted and focused, even tailored to a specific unit or system, providing limited to no physical destruction (unlike a cruise missile) and potentially resulting in no loss of life. There are several incident response frameworks and approaches that an organization can implement to enhance its security posture. Usually, these will address specific adverse events such as computer security incidents, which in turn are limited in scope and coverage, typically within an organization. Nations have made limited effort in confronting severe cyber-attacks targeting and/or threatening them, as well as in preventing these attacks from being launched. In this work, we identify and discuss a decision-taking framework that may allow state actors to adopt new options against severe cyber-attacks, not always complying with international norms. Such options are neither encouraged nor supported. On the contrary, we discuss them so that the international community is made aware of such potential frameworks. More specifically, by defining clear thresholds, roles, and responsibilities, by introducing a structured chain of command, and by identifying the potential of certain actions, policy makers can recognize an extended decision space that may lead to unpredictable deterrence options against cyber-attacks.",cyber warfare reality take increase importance government statesponsored actor nonstate sponsor actor use cyberattacks weapon choice due specific characteristic cyberattacks highly target focus even tailor specific unit system provide limited physical destruction unlike cruise missile potentially result loss life several incident response framework approach organization implement enhance security posture usually address specific adverse event computer security incident turn limited scope coverage typically within organization nation make limited effort confront severe cyberattacks target andor threaten well prevent attack launch work identify discus decisiontaking framework may allow state actor adopt new option severe cyberattacks always comply international norm option neither encourage support contrary discus international community make aware potential framework specifically define clear threshold role responsibility introduce structure chain command identify potential certain action policy maker recognize extend decision space may lead unpredictable deterrence option cyberattacks,0.1103640906339957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09364310839767916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645837792978409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07311948516379221,0.6719510329786954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480993213677563,0.0,0.11245881020302714,0.3251005076543618,0.0,0.0,0.14221786078329862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114660997249182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24961986427355126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480993213677563,0.0,0.1277720192805187,0.0,0.2440781693239812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09650638483107753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309537142416702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287853574406369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194362735453275,0.0,0.0,0.1220390846619906,0.1720938015595182,0.0,0.0,0.10287853574406369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619074284833404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07577599639338962,0.0,0.0,0.09505088155650415,0.0

Modelling the dynamics of information warfare: an attacker-defender scenario using Lotka-Volterra equations,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-024-02245-7,22 October 2024,"Rashmikiran Pandey, Mrinal Pandey, Alexey Nikolaevich Nazarov","The dynamics of information warfare in an attacker-defender scenario pose significant challenges in today’s digital age. To address these challenges, this research models the dynamics of information warfare using modified Lotka-Volterra equations, adapted from predator-prey interactions, to simulate the interactions between attackers and defenders. The model captures the growth, interaction, and feedback loops of both populations, offering insights into their dynamics over time. By incorporating the attacker’s growth rate and the defender’s natural decline rate, and discretizing time for real-time simulation, the study reveals how attacker populations initially grow but decline as defenders enhance their countermeasures. The defender population stabilizes as their defensive capabilities improve, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in representing the complex dynamics of information warfare.",dynamic information warfare attackerdefender scenario pose significant challenge today digital age address challenge research model dynamic information warfare use modify lotkavolterra equation adapt predatorprey interaction simulate interaction attacker defender model capture growth interaction feedback loop population offering insight dynamic time incorporate attacker growth rate defender natural decline rate discretizing time realtime simulation study reveals attacker population initially grow decline defender enhance countermeasure defender population stabilizes defensive capability improve demonstrate model effectiveness represent complex dynamic information warfare,0.16040641912216186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28053044290495066,0.0,0.19033198435816856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14952669322455617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18140243053634428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4903528386754938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4812192573664856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134122518823709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13814975013428027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33330333944783835,0.0,0.11013506446754849,0.0,0.0,0.41444925040284086,0.0
AI and Warfare: A Rational Choice Approach,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41302-024-00280-7,19 June 2024,Atin Basuchoudhary,"Artificial intelligence has been a hot topic in recent years, particularly as it relates to warfare and military operations. While rational choice approaches have been widely used to understand the causes of war, there is little literature on using the rational choice methodology to investigate the role of AI in warfare systematically. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring how rational choice models can inform our understanding of the power and limitations of AI in warfare. This theoretical approach suggests (a) an increase in the demand for moral judgment due to a reduction in the price of AI and (b) that without a human in the AI decision-making loop, peace is impossible; the very nature of AI rules out peace through mutually assured destruction.",artificial intelligence hot topic recent year particularly relates warfare military operation rational choice approach widely use understand cause war little literature use rational choice methodology investigate role ai warfare systematically paper aim fill gap explore rational choice model inform understand power limitation ai warfare theoretical approach suggests increase demand moral judgment due reduction price ai b without human ai decisionmaking loop peace impossible nature ai rule peace mutually assure destruction,0.0,0.7302135635477975,0.12123290940463871,0.0,0.19802071757797468,0.0,0.12628188553847272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668972119856554,0.0,0.0,0.12123290940463871,0.0,0.0,0.12368723667861486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384594601105705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12628188553847272,0.11668972119856554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13509540305339862,0.08858905729987769,0.0,0.0,0.1460427127095595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12368723667861486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12903387943242128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.276918920221141,0.16023835002658798,0.0,0.12368723667861486,0.3014964597123174,0.12903387943242128

Comparable problems exist for related technologies that leverage smartphones, such as contact tracing applications, and non-medical health monitoring devices. In analogous situations, these vulnerabilities may be exploited in the cyber domain to overload the crisis management systems with false alarms and to interfere with the interests of target countries, with consequences on their economy and their political equilibria.

Social media platform Telegram played a vital role in coordinating and mobilizing action transnationally, foregrounding the impact of platform design and use in the trajectory of war’s mediatization. Our study contributes to empirical research and theory around cyber resistance tactics and platform affordances. We use qualitative thematic analysis to examine Telegram posts from the first two months of the full-scale invasion on select pro-Ukrainian resistance channels, identifying a range of tactics constructed within Telegram. This includes a phenomenon of “kitting” whereby capable members and moderators provide tools and templates, along with guidance, to participants to lower the access barrier to cyber resistance. We discuss Telegram’s affordances in relation to these tactics and, noting how Telegram is used to coordinate action on other social media, we propose a model of user-affordances interaction in a multiplatform media environment.

Cyber range design framework for cyber security education and training,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00680-4,18 March 2023,"M. N. Katsantonis, A. Manikas, I. Mavridis, D. Gritzalis","The need for effective training of cyber security personnel working in critical infrastructures and in the corporate has brought attention to the evolution of Cyber Ranges (CRs) as learning and training tools. Although CRs have been organized for many years, there is a lack of standards and common methodologies that facilitate their development and optimize their effectiveness. Aiming at strengthening cyber security education and research that utilize well designed CRs, we first analyze the CRs domain to identify key characteristics, strengths and fundamental weaknesses, and based on these outcomes we propose the Cyber Range Design Framework (CRDF), which includes the CR Architecture and the CR Life-Cycle. The CR Architecture presents the main components of CRDF compliant CRs, whereas the CR Life-Cycle presents the development phases of such approaches and the activities these phases embrace. CRDF builds on the Conceptual Framework for eLearning and Training (COFELET) and on the Exercise Life-Cycle. COFELET is particularly elaborated for the development of cyber security educational approaches, by adopting its design considerations that were based on widely adopted educational theories and approaches (e.g., scenario-based, reuse of elements).

‘“Son – you’ll be a soldier one day”: reconceptualising YouTube discourses on participation in memetic warfare’,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-022-00051-8,23 September 2022,Timothy Noël Peacock,"“Son – you’ll be a soldier one day”, one of thousands of comments on a YouTube video about using memes (particularly viral images) in war. Memes have grown in global importance, from their central propaganda/morale-influencing role in the War in Ukraine to political campaign conflicts around major issues to virtual ‘battles’ involving online communities. However, while citizen participation in discourses concerning conflict has been receiving increased attention, such wider participation around meme conflict remains under-explored in scholarship. The online audio-visual and textual discourse around memetic warfare is important both in understanding wider public views of conflict, and, particularly in this case, given the blurring of distinctions in which acts of speech or creating videos may themselves involve directly contributing to meme ‘warfare’. This article will aim to map emerging perceptions of this digital participation, including how views of memetic warfare are framed by particular historical analogies and tropes from popular culture. The research draws on comments of selected YouTube videos on memetic warfare. The new framework adopted may serve as a basis for future investigation of online public debates and attitudes towards memetic or other forms of technological innovation in war, such as broader definitions of cyber, drone, or space security.",son youll soldier one day one thousand comment youtube video use meme particularly viral image war meme grown global importance central propagandamoraleinfluencing role war ukraine political campaign conflict around major issue virtual battle involve online community however citizen participation discourse concern conflict receive increase attention wider participation around meme conflict remains underexplored scholarship online audiovisual textual discourse around memetic warfare important understand wider public view conflict particularly case give blurring distinction act speech create video may involve directly contribute meme warfare article aim map emerge perception digital participation include view memetic warfare frame particular historical analogy trope popular culture research draw comment select youtube video memetic warfare new framework adopt may serve basis future investigation online public debate attitude towards memetic form technological innovation war broader definition cyber drone space security,0.0,0.0,0.11284641858310744,0.0,0.0,0.11284641858310744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11513096363163577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5029998034851786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07196232570211206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012504215584486,0.0,0.16155149728145585,0.12283474052321045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10665186607618533,0.12574995087129465,0.13593996193252186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10861751307781109,0.11284641858310744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010774336226634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497911373405502,0.41990153495008203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12283474052321045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23509224656771774,0.0,0.0,0.0908196475059298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010774336226634,0.08468515725595682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288812936121012,0.07457679605713956,0.0,0.3453928908949073,0.37418657866749566,0.0
Anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems using actuator state transition model,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-024-02128-x,23 August 2024,"Rajneesh Kumar Pandey, Tanmoy Kanti Das","Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are vulnerable to cyber attacks which disrupt the operations of the associated physical process. Sensors are deployed in CPS to observe its functioning and control systems like actuators, Remote Terminal Units (RTU), programmable logic controllers (PLC), etc., are used to change the state of the CPS. Any abnormal state transitions due to cyber attack or natural fault may not be detected by the traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Behavior specification-based IDS, which employs laws of physics to detect the intrusion, may be helpful in this context. However, specifying acceptable behaviors based on the laws of physics for all the installed control systems for a complex CPS like a smart grid, water treatment plant, etc., is a challenging task. Here, we employ a data-driven strategy to model the behavior of each control system installed in a CPS. Later, we use the models to predict the acceptable states of all the control systems. We utilize an AI-based classifier to model control systems such as actuators. Subsequently, we juxtapose the actual states of the actuators with their predicted states, examining how this combination correlates with the overall state of the CPS to identify anomalies. Typically, there should be a strong correlation between predicted and actual states, making the Hamming distance between them a crucial factor in our experimentation. To establish the relationship between controller states and CPS states, we employ a novel deep neural network-based approach for classification. Experimental validation of our approach leverages data from a water treatment testbed, where we achieve superior performance compared to the most state-of-the-art methods, achieving aF1-scoreof0.96.",cyberphysical system cps vulnerable cyber attack disrupt operation associate physical process sensor deployed cps observe function control system like actuator remote terminal unit rtu programmable logic controller plc etc use change state cps abnormal state transition due cyber attack natural fault may detect traditional intrusion detection system id behavior specificationbased id employ law physic detect intrusion may helpful context however specify acceptable behavior base law physic instal control system complex cps like smart grid water treatment plant etc challenge task employ datadriven strategy model behavior control system instal cps later use model predict acceptable state control system utilize aibased classifier model control system actuator subsequently juxtapose actual state actuator predict state examine combination correlate overall state cps identify anomaly typically strong correlation predict actual state make ham distance crucial factor experimentation establish relationship controller state cps state employ novel deep neural networkbased approach classification experimental validation approach leverage data water treatment testbed achieve superior performance compare stateoftheart method achieve afscoreof,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10822644022843254,0.0,0.0,0.07567377124475402,0.12303747144855787,0.0,0.07052230499233879,0.0,0.05576781179255246,0.0,0.07567377124475402,0.0,0.3882980261519418,0.6372235525760626,0.0,0.08450660946672552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05663841621745777,0.0,0.07981832967368921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15134754248950805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07052230499233879,0.0,0.07212348506710957,0.0,0.191327149366522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383517614987621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08479690546843793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5350505819920308,0.0,0.06151873572427893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757682743284881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tracing the evolution of cyber resilience: a historical and conceptual review,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00811-x,01 February 2024,"Vasiliki Tzavara, Savvas Vassiliadis","In 2000, during a time when cyber security research was focused on the risks and threats posed by digital systems, the notion of being able to withstand and recover from cyber attacks, also known as cyber resilience, emerged. Recently, this concept has gained increasing attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid acceleration of digitalization. While experts acknowledge the distinction between cyber security and cyber resilience, the exact definition and evolution of the latter remain somewhat ambiguous. The aim of this paper is to offer a thorough comprehension of how the notion of cyber resilience has developed throughout history. It delves into the concept of cyber resilience and its progression over time in response to the rising frequency and complexity of cyber threats. Cyber resilience, a new concept, has gained significant recognition as a critical component of cyber security strategy across diverse sectors, encompassing public and private domains alike. It begins with an overview of the definition and key components of cyber resilience and then traces the origin of the concept from its early development in the 2000s. The paper also explores the major milestones and events that have shaped the evolution of this capacity, including changes in technology and societal factors, up to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This study provides valuable insights into future challenges for ensuring the continued resilience of digital infrastructure by examining the historical and contextual factors that have influenced the concept.",time cyber security research focus risk threat pose digital system notion able withstand recover cyber attack also know cyber resilience emerge recently concept gain increase attention due covid pandemic rapid acceleration digitalization expert acknowledge distinction cyber security cyber resilience exact definition evolution latter remain somewhat ambiguous aim paper offer thorough comprehension notion cyber resilience developed throughout history delf concept cyber resilience progression time response rise frequency complexity cyber threat cyber resilience new concept gain significant recognition critical component cyber security strategy across diverse sector encompass public private domain alike begin overview definition key component cyber resilience trace origin concept early development paper also explores major milestone event shape evolution capacity include change technology societal factor covid pandemic outbreak study provide valuable insight future challenge ensure continued resilience digital infrastructure examine historical contextual factor influence concept,0.0,0.0,0.10948303931277283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10165084078879079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214826818078997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10738030048498916,0.7679924322001055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10738030048498916,0.0,0.19646532026631547,0.11652794083682058,0.0,0.11917366004639908,0.0,0.0,0.10738030048498916,0.0,0.12200198276281078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10538017602743618,0.10948303931277283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214826818078997,0.0,0.0,0.160006046059188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09823266013315773,0.11404266965790293,0.0,0.0,0.08811277454003608,0.0,0.0,0.10948303931277283,0.0,0.24648336697280476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10165084078879079,0.09075849374961457,0.0,0.08562750336111842,0.0,0.17125500672223684,0.21896607862554565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It is noted that the networked cyber-physical system should take defense measures into account at the beginning of its construction. From the conservative defensive perspective, this paper proposes a robust optimal defense resource allocation strategy to reduce the maximum possible losses of the networked cyber-physical system caused by potential attacks. Then, based on the robust optimal allocation strategy, it can be proved that the topology of the networked cyber-physical system has a great influence on the loss function. In order to further improve security, the effects of adding redundant connections are investigated. Furthermore, by taking geographical knowledge into account, a hexagonal construction scheme is proposed for providing a geographically-feasible and economically-viable solution for building networked cyber-physical systems, where the loss function has a cubic decay.",networked cyberphysical system face serious security threat malicious attack note networked cyberphysical system take defense measure account begin construction conservative defensive perspective paper proposes robust optimal defense resource allocation strategy reduce maximum possible loss networked cyberphysical system cause potential attack base robust optimal allocation strategy prove topology networked cyberphysical system great influence loss function order improve security effect add redundant connection investigate furthermore take geographical knowledge account hexagonal construction scheme propose provide geographicallyfeasible economicallyviable solution building networked cyberphysical system loss function cubic decay,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088402681296373,0.0,0.2916557708716009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20023818481808947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28543542855449744,0.2458648287282805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41127930855169775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088402681296373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21431559951419277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The introduction of geospatial data for air bombardment in recent times in the warfare had change the dynamics of taming violence in the country. Conflict and Tyre Burning theories are used to explain the nature of violence. How had the geospatial data and air warfare assisted in mitigating terrorism in Nigeria? Data from Nigeria defence Head headquarters and Nigeria satellite Commission were analyzed. Results revealed that geospatial information analysis gives the military superior edge over the terrorist groups and it helps to engage in coordinated warfare.

Yoo, Omar Alhussein, Ilyas Farhat, Ernesto Damiani","Traditionally, cyber-attack detection relies on reactive, assistive techniques, where pattern-matching algorithms help human experts to scan system logs and network traffic for known virus or malware signatures. Recent research has introduced effective Machine Learning (ML) models for cyber-attack detection, promising to automate the task of detecting, tracking and blocking malware and intruders. Much less effort has been devoted to cyber-attack prediction, especially beyond the short-term time scale of hours and days. Approaches that can forecast attacks likely to happen in the longer term are desirable, as this gives defenders more time to develop and share defensive actions and tools. Today, long-term predictions of attack waves are mostly based on the subjective perceptiveness of experienced human experts, which can be impaired by the scarcity of cyber-security expertise. This paper introduces a novel ML-based approach that leverages unstructured big data and logs to forecast the trend of cyber-attacks at a large scale, years in advance. To this end, we put forward a framework that utilises a monthly dataset of major cyber incidents in 36 countries over the past 11 years, with new features extracted from three major categories of big data sources, namely the scientific research literature, news, blogs, and tweets. Our framework not only identifies future attack trends in an automated fashion, but also generates a threat cycle that drills down into five key phases that constitute the life cycle of all 42 known cyber threats.",traditionally cyberattack detection relies reactive assistive technique patternmatching algorithm help human expert scan system log network traffic know virus malware signature recent research introduce effective machine learn ml model cyberattack detection promising automate task detect track block malware intruder much less effort devote cyberattack prediction especially beyond shortterm time scale hour day approach forecast attack likely happen longer term desirable give defender time develop share defensive action tool today longterm prediction attack wave mostly base subjective perceptiveness experienced human expert impaired scarcity cybersecurity expertise paper introduces novel mlbased approach leverage unstructured big data log forecast trend cyberattacks large scale year advance end put forward framework utilises monthly dataset major cyber incident country past year new feature extract three major category big data source namely scientific research literature news blog tweet framework identifies future attack trend automate fashion also generates threat cycle drill five key phase constitute life cycle know cyber threat,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22116717557307639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3771515998192508,0.0,0.14411652990838217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17269428887768723,0.15870202797645747,0.0,0.13814492304259052,0.23148795280169557,0.0,0.3262270198600283,0.14738863674265928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25594181385614384,0.15088657940279002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26065894893784614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15088657940279002,0.15464385796889968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13032947446892307,0.0,0.14738863674265928,0.11396484441340259,0.0,0.0,0.09894415003309052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13814492304259052,0.0,0.21794785381287987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21180050999791475,0.27080742346035114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28823305981676434

It adopts Forceville’s theory of Multimodal Metaphor [1,2] as its theoretical framework. Twenty visual and multimodal depictions were collected from online platforms and were analysed to identify metaphorical representations. The results reveal a higher frequency of use of multimodal metaphors over monomodal ones, which can potentially be attributed to the former employing both visual and verbal cues; thus, improving message clarity and comprehensibility. The analysis depicts a predominantly negative image of Jordanian perceptions and attitudes, portraying the law as asilencer, barbed wires, andhandcuffswhich demonstrates its perceived restriction of Jordanians’ freedom of speech in digital space and their online activities. Jordanians were also visually depicted aspotential criminals, suggesting that ordinary citizens are potentially viewed as suspects or criminals under the new Cyber Crime Law.

AI-enabled remote warfare: sustaining the western Warfare paradigm?,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-021-00337-w,21 July 2021,Ash Rossiter,"The most prominent feature of Western approaches to warfare in recent decades has been the centrality of precision-strike systems and related capabilities—most notably unmanned platforms—for delivering lethal force with ever-greater remoteness. Comparative advantages derived from this ‘remote warfare’ are waning due to competitors’ partial adoption of precision weapon systems and the development of countermeasures. Analyses by military experts and technology enthusiasts in the West propose that Artificial Intelligence (AI), properly harnessed, will soon resuscitate former advantages derived from remote warfare, which have been subject to diminishing returns. The assumptions underpinning this conclusion, however, rest on weaker ground than is claimed. First, AI boosters—unwittingly or otherwise—frequently overstate the near-term impact of AI on important aspects of remote warfare, downplaying enduring technological challenges, and overlooking vulnerabilities associated with greater reliance on AI-enabled systems. Furthermore, it is far from clear whether over the longer-term AI will enhance and entrench the central aspects of remote warfare. Indeed, the technology may lean toward methods of warfare antithetical to the Western warfare paradigm, such as mass over precision or the widespread deployment of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS).",prominent feature western approach warfare recent decade centrality precisionstrike system related capabilitiesmost notably unmanned platformsfor deliver lethal force evergreater remoteness comparative advantage derive remote warfare wan due competitor partial adoption precision weapon system development countermeasure analysis military expert technology enthusiast west propose artificial intelligence ai properly harness soon resuscitate former advantage derive remote warfare subject diminish return assumption underpin conclusion however rest weaker ground claimed first ai boostersunwittingly otherwisefrequently overstate nearterm impact ai important aspect remote warfare downplay endure technological challenge overlook vulnerability associate great reliance aienabled system furthermore far clear whether longerterm ai enhance entrench central aspect remote warfare indeed technology may lean toward method warfare antithetical western warfare paradigm mass precision widespread deployment lethal autonomous weapon system law,0.0,0.48242101149336475,0.0,0.08426499365409254,0.08176491067085215,0.0,0.1042863314171574,0.1143428377186573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426499365409254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981939272172721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897836612450063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09295462218774816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10214361387887794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143428377186573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897836612450063,0.1042863314171574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042863314171574,0.0,0.0,0.10214361387887794,0.5125114629036849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15660415914022824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5809587999422013,0.0
To subdue the enemies without fighting: Chinese state-sponsored disinformation as digital warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-022-00052-7,23 September 2022,Isabel Fangyi Lu,"This paper examines the nuanced practices of Chinese state-sponsored disinformation campaigns as participatory digital warfare. Utilising Sun Tzu’s three conceptsqizheng(奇正), xingshi(形势) andxushi(虚实), it proposes to analyse disinformation beyond the framework of political communication. With two examples, I analyse how disinformation campaigns can implicate contemporary China’s state-building. I demonstrate that disinformation campaigns strategically utilise suggestive half-lies to mobilise alliances and silence enemies regardless of their nationalities. Depending on whether they conform to the Party agenda, some foreign actors can be enlisted as allies, while critical citizens portrayed as enemies. Overall, the paper argues that Chinese state-sponsored disinformation campaigns can stealthily recruit netizens to combat in an ongoing state-making project that potentially consolidates the authoritarian Party-state. Addressing the gap between Chinese traditional war philosophies and contemporary, technologically informed practices, this paper points out the significance of participatory and cultural countermeasures.",paper examines nuanced practice chinese statesponsored disinformation campaign participatory digital warfare utilise sun tzus three conceptsqizheng xingshi andxushi proposes analyse disinformation beyond framework political communication two example analyse disinformation campaign implicate contemporary china statebuilding demonstrate disinformation campaign strategically utilise suggestive halflies mobilise alliance silence enemy regardless nationality depend whether conform party agenda foreign actor enlist ally critical citizen portrayed enemy overall paper argues chinese statesponsored disinformation campaign stealthily recruit netizens combat ongoing statemaking project potentially consolidates authoritarian partystate address gap chinese traditional war philosophy contemporary technologically inform practice paper point significance participatory cultural countermeasure,0.27031329698603507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32916014274971606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2754438657218738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25197902711216924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2654214475350212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6156532017468499,0.0,0.3056953041400115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2865231350137071,0.23280685798586478,0.0

A personalized learning theory-based cyber-security training exercise,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00704-z,02 June 2023,"Nabin Chowdhury, Vasileios Gkioulos","Current enterprises’ needs for skilled cyber-security (CS) professionals have prompted the development of diverse CS training programs and offerings. It has been noted that even though enterprise staff is now more aware of security threats, the number of successful attacks against companies has all but decreased over the years. Several criticisms were raised against current CS training offerings, which often made them inadequate, or unable to change participants’ behavior and security attitude. One of the main factors CS training programs are often not very effective is the lack of engagement or motivation of participants. This is often the result of training not being tailored to the needs or preferences of participants. In our previous work, we tackled this issue by developing a personalized learning theory-based model for developing CS training frameworks. In this work, we utilize the model to develop two CS training exercises: two game-based scenarios using the CS training video game Cyber CIEGE and one table-top team exercise. The exercises are later tested by involving a group of 12 students from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU) Information Security master’s degree program. According to the results of the experiment and the feedback from the students, students felt more engaged during the exercises due to having been participants in their development process. This has in turn motivated them to continue using the training tools independently in their spare time. Further research is recommended to establish whether the training development model is adequate for different target groups, as well as better performing than other models when developing full-fledged training programs.",current enterprise need skilled cybersecurity c professional prompt development diverse c training program offering note even though enterprise staff aware security threat number successful attack company decrease year several criticism raise current c training offering often make inadequate unable change participant behavior security attitude one main factor c training program often effective lack engagement motivation participant often result training tailor need preference participant previous work tackle issue develop personalize learn theorybased model develop c training framework work utilize model develop two c training exercise two gamebased scenario use c training video game cyber ciege one tabletop team exercise exercise later test involve group student norwegian institute science technology ntnu information security master degree program accord result experiment feedback student student felt engage exercise due participant development process turn motivate continue use training tool independently spare time research recommend establish whether training development model adequate different target group well well perform model develop fullfledged training program,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10989689323085511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07548118250909615,0.0,0.0,0.12076070629374554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5153647482862158,0.34827340312950805,0.13518340812681523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11186699275890627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609113437650269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259808435737761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259808435737761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45571502856916546,0.2576823741431079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526060090364297,0.2465879277318927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26647842805033656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13518340812681523,0.09257372119581322,0.0,0.09257372119581322,0.11836445019618647,0.0,0.156446993595911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259808435737761

These studies have enhanced the understanding of complex social systems and contributed to more sustainable artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystems. However, the incorporation of human or social factors increases system complexity, making traditional approaches inadequate for managing these complex systems and necessitating a novel operational paradigm. Over decades of work, a mature and comprehensive theory of parallel intelligence (PI) has been established. Rooted in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), PI adapts flexibly to various situations within complex systems through the ACP framework (Artificial systems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution), ensuring system reliability. This paper provides a detailed review and a novel perspective on PI, beginning with the historical and philosophical origins of CPSS and proceeding to present both the fundamental framework and technological implementations of PI. PI-based Industry 5.0 is highlighted, where three pillars are adopted to help realize the supposed vision. Additionally, the paper outlines applications of PI in multiple fields, such as transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture, and discusses the opportunities and challenges for imaginative intelligence.

Dhanamjayulu, Ravikumar Chinthaginjala, Baseem Khan","Cybersecurity is critical in today’s digitally linked and networked society. There is no way to overestimate the importance of cyber security as technology develops and becomes more pervasive in our daily lives. Cybersecurity is essential to people’s protection. One type of cyberattack known as “credential stuffing” involves using previously acquired usernames and passwords by attackers to access user accounts on several websites without authorization. This is feasible as a lot of people use the same passwords and usernames on several different websites. Maintaining the security of online accounts requires defence against credential-stuffing attacks. The problems of credential stuffing attacks, failure detection, and prediction can be handled by the suggested EWOA-ANN model. Here, a novel optimization approach known as Enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm (EWOA) is put on to train the neural network.

A narrative perspective of island detection methods under the lens of cyber-attack in data-driven smart grid,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43067-023-00083-4,14 March 2023,"Apoorva Shukla, Soham Dutta, Sourav Kumar Sahu, Pradip Kumar Sadhu","As criminals and hackers are developing new methods to interfere with the operation of the power grid, the nature of grid vulnerabilities and threats is continuously evolving. The growing interest in transitioning the unidirectional power system to a bidirectional data-driven modern grid will further escalate these issues. The question of cyber security becomes essential in particular critical decisions such as island detection. The incorrect decision of island occurrence may completely disrupt the operation of a portion of the grid, causing substantial damage to electrical equipment and grid maintenance workers. Fast monitoring and accurate control of unplanned islanding detection are essential for distributed generation-based active networks for providing continuous power supply to critical loads. Considering the above aspects, this paper serves on the perspective of different island detection methods and various aspects of cyber security. The type of cyber-attacks is categorized in terms of their behavior. Key points are discussed about how, when, and in what fashion and degree it can harm all the sectors of the grid, i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution system. Finally, the impact of cyber-physical attacks on the islanding decision system is presented. The research remedies for such measures are also presented. Moreover, a comparison is being made among various island detection methods based on the extent of impact of different cyber-attacks on the operation of these methods. Some promising future solutions for cyber-secure island detection methods are also suggested.",criminal hacker develop new method interfere operation power grid nature grid vulnerability threat continuously evolve grow interest transition unidirectional power system bidirectional datadriven modern grid escalate issue question cyber security becomes essential particular critical decision island detection incorrect decision island occurrence may completely disrupt operation portion grid cause substantial damage electrical equipment grid maintenance worker fast monitoring accurate control unplanned islanding detection essential distribute generationbased active network provide continuous power supply critical load consider aspect paper serf perspective different island detection method various aspect cyber security type cyberattacks categorize term behavior key point discuss fashion degree harm sector grid ie generation transmission distribution system finally impact cyberphysical attack islanding decision system present research remedy measure also present moreover comparison make among various island detection method base extent impact different cyberattacks operation method promising future solution cybersecure island detection method also suggest,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018519314550564,0.0,0.09192069018162878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122364141083622,0.0,0.16940952121196348,0.11014821293680975,0.20244728282167243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5201869077838102,0.09400771183518918,0.0,0.19727050277838054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09623877654191909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16037038629101127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09192069018162878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09192069018162878,0.0,0.47003855917594584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400771183518918,0.0726892824964738,0.0,0.28871632962575733,0.06310875349453804,0.0,0.0,0.31211214467028603,0.17272692651293334,0.0,0.0,0.07748883103033471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950596561969895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12962225224111373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0675455101236688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20244728282167243,0.0,0.0,0.0
Smart soldiers: towards a more ethical warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-022-01385-3,29 January 2022,Femi Richard Omotoyinbo,"It is a truism that, due to human weaknesses, human soldiers have yet to have sufficiently ethical warfare. It is arguable that the likelihood of human soldiers to breach the Principle of Non-Combatant Immunity, for example, is higher in contrast tosmart soldierswho are emotionally inept. Hence, this paper examines the possibility that the integration of ethics into smart soldiers will help address moral challenges in modern warfare. The approach is to develop and employ smart soldiers that are enhanced with ethical capabilities. Advocates of this approach think that it is more realistic to make competent entities (i.e., smart soldiers) become morally responsible than to enforce moral responsibility on human soldiers with inherent (moral) limitations. This view somewhat seeks a radical transition from the usual anthropocentric warfare to arobocentricwarfare with the belief that the transition has moral advantages. However, the paper defends the claim that despite human limitations, the capacity ofethically enhanced smart soldiersfor moral sensitivity is artificial and unauthentic. There are significant problems with the three models of programming ethics into smart soldiers. Also, there are further challenges from the absence of emotion as a moral gauge, and the problems of apportioning responsibility in case of mishap from the actions or omissions of smart soldiers. Among other reasons, the paper takes the replacement of human soldiers as an extreme approach towards an ethical warfare. This replacement predicates ethical complications that outweigh the benefits from the exclusive use of smart soldiers.",truism due human weakness human soldier yet sufficiently ethical warfare arguable likelihood human soldier breach principle noncombatant immunity example high contrast tosmart soldierswho emotionally inept hence paper examines possibility integration ethic smart soldier help address moral challenge modern warfare approach develop employ smart soldier enhance ethical capability advocate approach think realistic make competent entity ie smart soldier become morally responsible enforce moral responsibility human soldier inherent moral limitation view somewhat seek radical transition usual anthropocentric warfare arobocentricwarfare belief transition moral advantage however paper defends claim despite human limitation capacity ofethically enhance smart soldiersfor moral sensitivity artificial unauthentic significant problem three model program ethic smart soldier also challenge absence emotion moral gauge problem apportion responsibility case mishap action omission smart soldier among reason paper take replacement human soldier extreme approach towards ethical warfare replacement predicate ethical complication outweigh benefit exclusive use smart soldier,0.11415006424904467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29056643638350227,0.0,0.12353346292753306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12099528449146937,0.19963395640061896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12909146163836815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581829232767363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.684900385494268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12622556191089296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11415006424904467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2599829653890967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.151775201366734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837544628104219,0.0,0.0,0.3932461790524141,0.0
The trans-national cybercrime court: towards a new harmonisation of cyber law regime in ASEAN,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-023-00105-x,06 December 2023,"Kwan Yuen Iu, Vanessa Man-Yi Wong","Legal harmonisation of cyber laws in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is necessary to combat the transnational nature of cybercrimes. However, this is a difficult task in ASEAN as it requires all ASEAN member states to agree on a uniform cybercrime regulatory framework. The rapid evolution of cybercrime also undermines the strength of a static convention. This leads to the following question: How can a harmonized regulatory framework that would efficiently tackle the rapid evolution of cybercrime be designed? Regrettably, the Budapest Convention failed to facilitate the legal harmonisation in ASEAN with its inability to reach universal consensus. This paper argues that a regional cybercrime court, namely the ASEAN Cybercrime Court, can be an alternative approach to achieving legal harmonisation with the prevalence of cybercrimes. The theoretical framework of this paper is based on the concept of international common law articulated by Andrew Guzman and Timothy Meyer, in which certain members unable to agree on a broad agreement can instead agree to shallow rules to create an institution with authority to promulgate rules. In effect, it reduces the transaction costs for reaching a consensus. This paper also analyses the feasibility and merit of the creation of the ASEAN Cybercrime Court from three aspects: the jurisdiction, the existence of an independent prosecutorʼs office and the legal interpretation. Although the solution is not a perfect answer to legal harmonisation, it serves as a starting point on a path to progress ultimately leading to the conclusion of a binding multilateral treaty.",legal harmonisation cyber law association southeast asian nation asean necessary combat transnational nature cybercrime however difficult task asean require asean member state agree uniform cybercrime regulatory framework rapid evolution cybercrime also undermines strength static convention lead follow question harmonize regulatory framework would efficiently tackle rapid evolution cybercrime design regrettably budapest convention fail facilitate legal harmonisation asean inability reach universal consensus paper argues regional cybercrime court namely asean cybercrime court alternative approach achieve legal harmonisation prevalence cybercrime theoretical framework paper base concept international common law articulate andrew guzman timothy meyer certain member unable agree broad agreement instead agree shallow rule create institution authority promulgate rule effect reduces transaction cost reach consensus paper also analysis feasibility merit creation asean cybercrime court three aspect jurisdiction existence independent prosecutor office legal interpretation although solution perfect answer legal harmonisation serf start point path progress ultimately lead conclusion binding multilateral treaty,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059357457459980216,0.0575963635241842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07506166342215215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04497305269182355,0.0,0.8076964082297484,0.0,0.0,0.07858777646986158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19995712809146263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07676590777241489,0.0,0.0,0.16108943539709125,0.15353181554482978,0.4512754353536377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15460223387482763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06327672847410228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Artificial intelligence in the long view: from mechanical intelligence to cyber-social systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44163-022-00029-1,09 August 2022,"Bill Cope, Mary Kalantzis","Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a defining technology of our time, a source of fear as often as inspiration. Immersed in its practicalities, rarely do we get to ask the question, what is it? How does it impact our lives? How does it extend our human capacities? What are its risks? What are its limits? This paper is a theoretical and historical overview of the nature of binary computing that underpins AI and its relations with human intelligence. It also considers some philosophical questions about the semiotic or sense-creating work of computers. Our argument proceeds in five steps. We begin with an historical background: since Ada Lovelace, we have wondered about the intelligence of machines capable of computation, and the ways in which machine intelligence can extend human intelligence. Second, we ask, in what ways does binary computing extend human intelligence and delimit the scope of AI? Third, we propose a grammar with which to parse the practical meanings that are enabled with and through binary computing. Through this discussion, we raise the question of ontology as a counter-balance to what we will argue has been an over-emphasis on the instrumental reasoning processes of the algorithm. Fourth, we situate binary computing in the context of broad developments in modern societies which we characterize as a series of systems transitions: from industrial, to informational, to a new phase that we term “cyber-social.” Finally, we explore the risks inherent in a pervasively cyber-social system. These are narrowly captured in the technical domain, “cybersecurity.” We set out to reconceive this problem framework as the location for a potential solution, supplementing analyses of cybersecurity risk with a program of cyber-social trust.",artificial intelligence ai emerge define technology time source fear often inspiration immerse practicality rarely get ask question impact life extend human capacity risk limit paper theoretical historical overview nature binary compute underpins ai relation human intelligence also considers philosophical question semiotic sensecreating work computer argument proceeds five step begin historical background since ada lovelace wonder intelligence machine capable computation way machine intelligence extend human intelligence second ask way binary compute extend human intelligence delimit scope ai third propose grammar parse practical meaning enable binary compute discussion raise question ontology counterbalance argue overemphasis instrumental reason process algorithm fourth situate binary compute context broad development modern society characterize series system transition industrial informational new phase term cybersocial finally explore risk inherent pervasively cybersocial system narrowly capture technical domain cybersecurity set reconceive problem framework location potential solution supplement analysis cybersecurity risk program cybersocial trust,0.0,0.3764378161101077,0.0,0.08767039419914091,0.0,0.0,0.10850085413233042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125430859330789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216223764804015,0.0,0.0,0.11086535547618634,0.0,0.11338250800247052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09844491881819498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.401037230780043,0.09671119662436832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6376292577992367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607339055908801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767039419914091,0.0,0.0,0.07611533786361091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10850085413233042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124883865154985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13330589618504707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08146650091382282,0.0,0.0,0.10416279550516616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Al-Ghuraybi, Mohammed A. AlZain, Ben Soh","In this rapidly advancing era, technology has been progressing extensively and swiftly. As a result, the emergence of numerous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has become imperative to meet the technological demands of modern life. However, these systems generate a substantial amount of data, which poses challenges in terms of management, storage, and susceptibility to external attacks. This paper primarily focuses on the performance and security aspects of CPS, particularly in countering external threats, through the integration of blockchain technology and machine learning.

Cyber governance studies in ensuring cybersecurity: an overview of cybersecurity governance,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-021-00045-4,11 January 2022,"Serkan Savaş, Süleyman Karataş","With the exponential increase of digital data in cyber environments, security measures have gained more importance. Cybersecurity threats are revealed by national and international units, and the number of these threats is increasing daily. The elimination of cybersecurity risks is possible with an effective cybersecurity strategy. Since the concept of management is not sufficient, the implementation of this strategy is possible with cyber governance, which includes all stakeholders in the management processes. This study emphasizes the importance and necessity of cyber governance in ensuring cybersecurity. The research and results for cybersecurity governance have been examined. A descriptive research model was used to this end. In terms of research philosophy, a basic research model and a documentary research model have been created with regard to the application method. The universe of the research consists of studies obtained from Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, Google Scholar, and TR Index. Studies from the last 5 years have been downloaded with the determined keywords. The result showed that although there are studies that produce local solutions for cybersecurity governance in different countries, a general governance framework has not been established as yet. On the contrary, there is a latent struggle to retain the management of this area, not its governance.",exponential increase digital data cyber environment security measure gain importance cybersecurity threat reveal national international unit number threat increase daily elimination cybersecurity risk possible effective cybersecurity strategy since concept management sufficient implementation strategy possible cyber governance include stakeholder management process study emphasizes importance necessity cyber governance ensure cybersecurity research result cybersecurity governance examine descriptive research model use end term research philosophy basic research model documentary research model create regard application method universe research consists study obtain web science ebsco scopus google scholar tr index study last year download determine keywords result show although study produce local solution cybersecurity governance different country general governance framework establish yet contrary latent struggle retain management area governance,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18393479520761127,0.0,0.0,0.5885465765878753,0.08218509418835097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10980631932679047,0.08626493271460495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086694069355693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254166365990059,0.19228934667766076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465468156232602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465468156232602,0.0,0.2776249909797018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46426774292927997,0.20029760389868967,0.0,0.09614467333883038,0.0,0.07215139729955304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785333498887541,0.3188053890010326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15039093527455394,0.0,0.0,0.0635391161332221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233129146694786

An Explorative Study into the Importance of Defining and Classifying Cyber Terrorism in the United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00962-5,24 November 2021,Victoria Jangada Correia,"Terrorism, crime, and war are all familiar notions; however, the way in which these have been altered through cyberspace is not yet fully, nor unanimously, understood through definitions, theories, and approaches. Although the threat level of terrorism in the UK has lowered to moderate, the threat posed by cyber terrorism has nonetheless heightened throughout the COVID pandemic due to the greater necessity and presence of technology in our lives. This research aimed to highlight the necessity for a unanimous cyber terrorism definition and framework and further aimed to determine what perceptions are held by the general public regarding cyber terrorism through a mixed methods approach. The literature review confirms that there is an absence of a unanimously agreed upon definition of cyber terrorism, and furthermore that the existing academic definitions are not compatible with UK legislation. In addition, the literature review highlights an absence of a cyber terrorism framework that classifies what kind of terrorist activity is cyber enabled or cyber dependent. Quantitative data from the online survey find a couple of significant effects implying the necessity for greater diversity amongst stakeholders which could potentially enhance the detection and prevention of terrorism in the UK. The qualitative data find that although there is some agreement amongst the sample population in views held towards cyber terrorism, some misconceptions are nonetheless present which could have implications on the general public’s ability to identify and report cyber terrorist activity. Overall, the findings from the literature review and the primary data collection aid in developing a cyber terrorism definition that is compatible with UK legislative definitions, and further aids in developing a terrorist activity framework that succinctly highlights the inextricable links between traditional, cyber enabled, and cyber-dependent terrorism.",terrorism crime war familiar notion however way alter cyberspace yet fully unanimously understood definition theory approach although threat level terrorism uk lower moderate threat pose cyber terrorism nonetheless heighten throughout covid pandemic due great necessity presence technology life research aim highlight necessity unanimous cyber terrorism definition framework aim determine perception held general public regard cyber terrorism mixed method approach literature review confirms absence unanimously agree upon definition cyber terrorism furthermore exist academic definition compatible uk legislation addition literature review highlight absence cyber terrorism framework classifies kind terrorist activity cyber enable cyber dependent quantitative data online survey find couple significant effect imply necessity great diversity amongst stakeholder could potentially enhance detection prevention terrorism uk qualitative data find although agreement amongst sample population view held towards cyber terrorism misconception nonetheless present could implication general public ability identify report cyber terrorist activity overall finding literature review primary data collection aid develop cyber terrorism definition compatible uk legislative definition aid develop terrorist activity framework succinctly highlight inextricable link traditional cyber enable cyberdependent terrorism,0.0,0.0,0.17613000981178314,0.0,0.14384456787032496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6177510026568971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22583562265737697,0.0,0.10608713652420985,0.19171972247969532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09585986123984766,0.09585986123984766,0.0,0.24969238440574842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2944046478242581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09813488260808603,0.30173571913233166,0.0,0.0,0.09585986123984766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922996405105789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806500490589157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834652805757925,0.0,0.0,0.070875379153223,0.0,0.30173571913233166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06887629856560254,0.09585986123984766,0.13775259713120508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08984785697538998,0.0,0.0

Light footprint—heavy destabilising impact in Niger: why the Western understanding of remote warfare needs to be reconsidered,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-021-00362-9,11 January 2022,"James Rogers, Delina Goxho","Remote warfare has become a ‘catch-all’ term, used to describe the so-called ‘light footprint’, ‘low-risk’, and ‘distant’ characteristics of contemporary Western warfighting. Typified by a reliance on military airpower, new weapon technologies, special operations forces, and the support of local partners, proxies, and surrogates, this form of modern warfare has allowed the USA and its Western coalition member to meet national security threats globally, yet withoutr having to endure the heavy cost to their soldier’s lives that defined Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). Nevertheless, in this article, we argue that this perception of remote warfare needs reappraising. By analysing the case of Niger, we highlight how the means and mechanisms of remote warfare have now proliferated to a plethora of state actors, with varying ambitions, who combine their ‘light footprint’ tosaturatedistant zones of conflict and sovereign nations considered to be ‘strategic choke-points’. Although adopted as the blueprint for militarily effective and politically attuned global force deployment by a range of nations, we question the extent to which it is still politically useful, militarily effective, or indeed academically accurate to consider remote warfare as ‘light footprint’ at all.",remote warfare become catchall term use describe socalled light footprint lowrisk distant characteristic contemporary western warfighting typify reliance military airpower new weapon technology special operation force support local partner proxy surrogate form modern warfare allow usa western coalition member meet national security threat globally yet withoutr endure heavy cost soldier life define afghanistan iraq nevertheless article argue perception remote warfare need reappraise analyse case niger highlight mean mechanism remote warfare proliferate plethora state actor vary ambition combine light footprint tosaturatedistant zone conflict sovereign nation consider strategic chokepoint although adopt blueprint militarily effective politically attune global force deployment range nation question extent still politically useful militarily effective indeed academically accurate consider remote warfare light footprint,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13020648144712427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328424762461728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450950668234237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156852688401928,0.0,0.1450950668234237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450950668234237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356291791331362,0.0,0.14173138646149228,0.0,0.10959050686371365,0.0,0.1450950668234237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6665447721225852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771294911742255,0.0,0.0,0.11682657989233829,0.13858487361951555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10183546234866273,0.0,0.10183546234866273,0.0,0.0,0.0860495382496216,0.0,0.0,0.5396883483850939,0.0

Analyzing digital propaganda and conflict rhetoric: a study on Russia’s bot-driven campaigns and counter-narratives during the Ukraine crisis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-024-01322-w,23 August 2024,"Rebecca Marigliano, Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Kathleen M. Carley","The dissemination of disinformation has become a formidable weapon, with nation-states exploiting social media platforms to engineer narratives favorable to their geopolitical interests. This study delved into Russia’s orchestrated disinformation campaign, in three times periods of the 2022 Russian-Ukraine War: its incursion, its midpoint and the Ukrainian Kherson counteroffensive. This period is marked by a sophisticated blend of bot-driven strategies to mold online discourse. Utilizing a dataset derived from Twitter, the research examines how Russia leveraged automated agents to advance its political narrative, shedding light on the global implications of such digital warfare and the swift emergence of counter-narratives to thwart the disinformation campaign. This paper introduces a methodological framework that adopts a multiple-analysis model approach, initially harnessing unsupervised learning techniques, with TweetBERT for topic modeling, to dissect disinformation dissemination within the dataset. Utilizing Moral Foundation Theory and the BEND Framework, this paper dissects social-cyber interactions in maneuver warfare, thereby understanding the evolution of bot tactics employed by Russia and its counterparts within the Russian-Ukraine crisis. The findings highlight the instrumental role of bots in amplifying political narratives and manipulating public opinion, with distinct strategies in narrative and community maneuvers identified through the BEND framework. Moral Foundation Theory reveals how moral justifications were embedded in these narratives, showcasing the complexity of digital propaganda and its impact on public perception and geopolitical dynamics. The study shows how pro-Russian bots were used to foster a narrative of protection and necessity, thereby seeking to legitimize Russia’s actions in Ukraine whilst degrading both NATO and Ukraine’s actions. Simultaneously, the study explores the resilient counter-narratives of pro-Ukraine forces, revealing their strategic use of social media platforms to counteract Russian disinformation, foster global solidarity, and uphold democratic narratives. These efforts highlight the emerging role of social media as a digital battleground for narrative supremacy, where both sides leverage information warfare tactics to sway public opinion.",dissemination disinformation become formidable weapon nationstates exploit social medium platform engineer narrative favorable geopolitical interest study delve russia orchestrate disinformation campaign three time period russianukraine war incursion midpoint ukrainian kherson counteroffensive period marked sophisticated blend botdriven strategy mold online discourse utilize dataset derive twitter research examines russia leveraged automate agent advance political narrative shed light global implication digital warfare swift emergence counternarratives thwart disinformation campaign paper introduces methodological framework adopts multipleanalysis model approach initially harness unsupervised learn technique tweetbert topic model dissect disinformation dissemination within dataset utilize moral foundation theory bend framework paper dissects socialcyber interaction maneuver warfare thereby understand evolution bot tactic employ russia counterpart within russianukraine crisis finding highlight instrumental role bot amplify political narrative manipulate public opinion distinct strategy narrative community maneuver identify bend framework moral foundation theory reveals moral justification embed narrative showcasing complexity digital propaganda impact public perception geopolitical dynamic study show prorussian bot use foster narrative protection necessity thereby seek legitimize russia action ukraine whilst degrade nato ukraine action simultaneously study explores resilient counternarratives proukraine force reveal strategic use social medium platform counteract russian disinformation foster global solidarity uphold democratic narrative effort highlight emerge role social medium digital battleground narrative supremacy side leverage information warfare tactic sway public opinion,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844934653001166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25855892780102124,0.0,0.0,0.10455929735911902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723523686735267,0.0,0.2314294285500458,0.0,0.2140815611290658,0.0,0.0891853156536564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421216705562434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34714414282506867,0.0,0.0,0.1849146389683605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11914275843947167,0.0,0.14038437472379237,0.0,0.20911859471823804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30017257346327725,0.0,0.0,0.07730743346039426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044760496884832,0.0,0.32911871947828847,0.0,0.0,0.1022380248442416,0.1783706313073128,0.23888611792581504,0.0,0.0,0.20911859471823804,0.0,0.09605704531376626,0.10970623982609616,0.12696241082636395,0.0,0.09800169406738364,0.23888611792581504,0.0
Anomaly and cyber fraud detection in pipelines and supply chains for liquid fuels,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-022-09843-5,23 January 2022,"Alinne Beteto, Vidal Melo, Jessica Lin, Marwan Alsultan, Eduardo Mario Dias, Elizabeth Korte, DeAndre A. Johnson, Negin Moghadasi, Thomas L. Polmateer, James H. Lambert","A recent large-scale information disruption of the Colonial Pipeline across the USA has highlighted the cyber vulnerabilities of the supply chains of liquid fuels. Information disruption and associated anomalies have become routine events for critical infrastructure of sociotechnical systems. The logistics systems that support energy commodity supply chains are vulnerable to information threats that evolve throughout the system life cycles. Among the prevalent threats energy supply chains are malicious hacking, fraud, information theft, ransomware, and related irregular activities. Fraud and malicious activity are not new in the supply chains for liquid fuels, though mechanisms and consequences may be changing. This paper addresses information anomalies that are on a spectrum of errors, lost data, fraud, cyber, ransomware and related disruptions to logistics systems that support e-commerce and distribution of liquid fuels, particularly for challenges associated with human and organizational errors whose frequencies may be increasing in the latest pandemic. The lessons learned can help to improve the anomalies monitoring systems thus protecting the interests of consumers, industry, and the government. A case featuring fuels distribution, cyber-physical-systems and the internet of things (IoT) is presented to illustrate several issues that are challenging the design and operation of government-mandated inspection and detection processes for fraud and anomalies. In particular, an Authenticator and Transmitter System (SAT) concept is described for remote monitoring of fuel distribution points via a secure communication channel between the fuel pumps and government regulators. The data collected in this approach are used to analyze the behavior of fuel distribution points and detect anomalous behaviors that could indicate fraud and/or fraud-like precursors to other information disruptions. The method technologies that are described in this paper helps to detect precursors of fraud and other information irregularities in their earliest stages, and to enhance policies that protect the information systems of fuel pipelines and their related logistics systems. Methods such as described herein are integrated among layers of complex information technologies to protect the interests of the energy sector, consumers, and government.",recent largescale information disruption colonial pipeline across usa highlight cyber vulnerability supply chain liquid fuel information disruption associate anomaly become routine event critical infrastructure sociotechnical system logistics system support energy commodity supply chain vulnerable information threat evolve throughout system life cycle among prevalent threat energy supply chain malicious hack fraud information theft ransomware related irregular activity fraud malicious activity new supply chain liquid fuel though mechanism consequence may change paper address information anomaly spectrum error lose data fraud cyber ransomware related disruption logistics system support ecommerce distribution liquid fuel particularly challenge associate human organizational error whose frequency may increase late pandemic lesson learn help improve anomaly monitoring system thus protect interest consumer industry government case feature fuel distribution cyberphysicalsystems internet thing iot present illustrate several issue challenge design operation governmentmandated inspection detection process fraud anomaly particular authenticator transmitter system sat concept described remote monitoring fuel distribution point via secure communication channel fuel pump government regulator data collect approach use analyze behavior fuel distribution point detect anomalous behavior could indicate fraud andor fraudlike precursor information disruption method technology described paper help detect precursor fraud information irregularity early stage enhance policy protect information system fuel pipeline related logistics system method described herein integrate among layer complex information technology protect interest energy sector consumer government,0.08158198042759483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06922170239062671,0.0,0.0,0.19360397554698708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08647419514086638,0.1426765164864541,0.0,0.09680198777349354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313041316418808,0.10810096605228263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449038731388048,0.09445005450827908,0.10210371237060256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09226045702238052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31538559330919425,0.09445005450827908,0.08158198042759483,0.0,0.0,0.08475828668233373,0.0,0.7481737184776927,0.0,0.0,0.0993422692215506,0.09021222536335816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09445005450827908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18452091404476104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133825824322705,0.0,0.09445005450827908,0.12387159150786528,0.09680198777349354,0.0,0.0,0.08475828668233373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08647419514086638,0.10847231307974306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13258017905477454,0.0,0.13258017905477454,0.0,0.0,0.056014196457690624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The hidden hierarchy of far-right digital guerrilla warfare,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-021-00032-3,09 June 2021,"Letícia Cesarino, Pedro H. J. Nardelli","The polarizing tendency of politically leaned social media is usually claimed to be spontaneous, or a by-product of underlying platform algorithms. This contribution revisits both claims by articulating the digital world of social media and rules derived from capitalist accumulation in the post-Fordist age, from a transdisciplinary perspective articulating the human and exact sciences. Behind claims of individual freedom, there is a rigid pyramidal hierarchy of power heavily using military techniques developed in the late years of the cold war, namely Russia Reflexive Control and the Boyd’s decision cycle in the USA. This hierarchy is not the old-style “command-and-control” from Fordist times, but an “emergent” one, whereby individual agents respond to informational stimuli, coordinated to move as a swarm. Such a post-Fordist organizational structure resembles guerrilla warfare. In this new world, it is the far right who plays the revolutionaries by deploying avant-garde guerrilla methods, while the so-called left paradoxically appears as conservatives defending the existing structure of exploitation. Although the tactical goal is unclear, the strategic objective of far-right guerrillas is to hold on to power and benefit particular groups to accumulate more capital.

Evolutionary Functions of Cyber and Traditional Forms of Aggression in Adolescence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-021-00297-7,16 September 2021,"Kiana R. Lapierre, Andrew V. Dane","This study examined how cyber and traditional aggression and victimization were differentially related to adolescent reports of using aggression to pursue evolutionarily relevant functions. To consider variations in the power balance between perpetrators and victims, the study examined bullying, in which the power of the perpetrator exceeded that of the victim, and adversarial aggression, in which the perpetrator had equal or less power than the victim. Participants included 379 adolescents, ages 11–14 (M= 12.86; SD = .84). As expected, cyberbullying and traditional bullying were consistently associated with proactive functions, including dominance, aggression deterrence and intrasexual competition (competitive), seeking status and mates (impression management), and enjoyment (sadistic), in line with the goal-directed nature of bullying. In contrast, cyber and traditional forms of adversarial aggression and victimization were associated with competitive and reactive functions (for boys only in cyber form), consistent with expectations that adversarial aggression would occur in the context of intrasexual competition. Relations with functions differed by gender only for cyber aggression. Cyberbullying was more strongly linked to competitive functions for girls, whereas adversarial cyber aggression related to competitive functions only for boys, and linked more strongly with reactive functions for girls, suggesting that girls may be more risk averse in their use of cyber aggression. In addition, traditional bullying was associated with both proactive and reactive motives, whereas cyberbullying was related only to proactive functions. The implications of differentiating the evolutionarily relevant aggressive functions associated with adolescents’ experiences of bullying and adversarial aggression are discussed.",study examine cyber traditional aggression victimization differentially related adolescent report use aggression pursue evolutionarily relevant function consider variation power balance perpetrator victim study examine bullying power perpetrator exceed victim adversarial aggression perpetrator equal less power victim participant include adolescent age sd expect cyberbullying traditional bullying consistently associate proactive function include dominance aggression deterrence intrasexual competition competitive seek status mate impression management enjoyment sadistic line goaldirected nature bullying contrast cyber traditional form adversarial aggression victimization associate competitive reactive function boy cyber form consistent expectation adversarial aggression would occur context intrasexual competition relation function differ gender cyber aggression cyberbullying strongly link competitive function girl whereas adversarial cyber aggression related competitive function boy link strongly reactive function girl suggest girl may risk averse use cyber aggression addition traditional bullying associate proactive reactive motif whereas cyberbullying related proactive function implication differentiate evolutionarily relevant aggressive function associate adolescent experience bullying adversarial aggression discuss,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6010395066326837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5033957938028889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532695577546054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4754682702295425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13156516715798974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21812796714682275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1738949053511857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
The Shift of China’s Strategic Thinking on Cyberwarfare Since the 1990s,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-022-09813-3,23 June 2022,Tianjiao Jiang,"It has been widely argued that China has prepared for launching cyberwarfare against the United States for long time. There are two reasons for this. First, the revolution of cyber technology changed the offense-defense balance, which will lead to frequent cyber conflicts. Second, with the relative decline of the United States and the rising up of China in recent years, there has been growing concerns about a Thucydides Trap between the two great powers, and cyberwar is very likely to happen. However, except for disputes on cyber espionage, China showed restraint on the offensive use of its cyberpower. This paper argues that China’s strategic thinking on cyber offense, defense, and cyberwarfare has been evolving over the past decades. Through content analysis of official documents and academic writings, this paper sheds light on the recent discussions and development of China’s cyber offense and defense strategy. With China’s gradual access to the global Internet and extensive participation in the international economic division of labor, maintaining the stability of global cyberspace is of greater significance to China, and the cost of launching cyber warfare is higher and higher. Such findings help avoid miscalculation and maintain strategic stability between China and the United States in cyberspace.",widely argue china prepared launch cyberwarfare united state long time two reason first revolution cyber technology change offensedefense balance lead frequent cyber conflict second relative decline united state rise china recent year grow concern thucydides trap two great power cyberwar likely happen however except dispute cyber espionage china show restraint offensive use cyberpower paper argues china strategic think cyber offense defense cyberwarfare evolve past decade content analysis official document academic writing paper shed light recent discussion development china cyber offense defense strategy china gradual access global internet extensive participation international economic division labor maintain stability global cyberspace great significance china cost launch cyber warfare high high finding help avoid miscalculation maintain strategic stability china united state cyberspace,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07131818143592598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7945144897082543,0.0,0.09442347332182127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32421162922270497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08310701767729148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20414995441298378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09223449205683802,0.09931431121353179,0.0,0.0,0.09223449205683802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12383673018472643,0.0,0.0,0.10207497720649189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17289971721919628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22808159556179314,0.18037367366797047,0.07867270052505135,0.0,0.0,0.06627143343195983,0.0,0.0,0.08473443306113809,0.0,0.05599843231855828,0.0,0.0,0.07024256507335781,0.09018683683398523
"‘Smart’ warfare and China–U.S. stability: strengths, myths, and risks",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42533-021-00094-8,01 December 2021,Haotian Qi,"Both the U.S. and China are experiencing military transformation and modernization, a process through which their militaries are becoming increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence and associated technologies. Expecting an intelligence revolution in military affairs, both militaries look forward to increasing effectiveness and efficiency in intelligence, command and control, logistics, and weapon systems. Yet beneath the high promises of new technology, the strengths and weaknesses of such advances create substantial obstacles to achieving military stability between the two nations. This paper discusses the oft-neglected, multi-layered turbulence created at the intersection of technology and strategy that lies behind the current military transformation. Looking into the future, China and the U.S. need to voice concerns about the transformation’s impact on current and future conflict dynamics and take the necessary steps to enhance operational and strategic stability in an increasingly AI-integrated military arena.",u china experience military transformation modernization process military become increasingly reliant artificial intelligence associate technology expect intelligence revolution military affair military look forward increase effectiveness efficiency intelligence command control logistics weapon system yet beneath high promise new technology strength weakness advance create substantial obstacle achieve military stability two nation paper discus oftneglected multilayered turbulence create intersection technology strategy lie behind current military transformation look future china u need voice concern transformation impact current future conflict dynamic take necessary step enhance operational strategic stability increasingly aiintegrated military arena,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920887630963623,0.11974007189263564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457645908346359,0.0,0.11683082731263357,0.12288229541731795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11412238540552205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23366165462526714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973422854075066,0.0,0.10484250968675114,0.0,0.0,0.3208950533305187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7644621341674537,0.0,0.11412238540552205,0.0,0.08824248723824667,0.0,0.0,0.07661202839818343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115888072038225,0.0973422854075066,0.0,0.0,0.24599433136698717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The world is interconnected as never before, bringing close people, businesses, or other organizations. However, hackers are also coming close. New business and operational models require the collection and processing of massive amounts of data in real-time, involving utilization of complex information systems, large supply-chains, personal devices, etc. These impose several advantages for adversaries on the one hand (e.g., poorly protected or monitored elements, slow fashion of security updates/upgrades in components that gain little attention, etc.), and many difficulties for defenders on the other hand (e.g., administrate large and complex systems with high dynamicity) in this cyber-security interplay. Impactful attacks on ICT systems, critical infrastructures, and supply networks, as well as cyber-warfare are deriving the necessity for more effective defensives. This paper presents a swarm-intelligence solution for incident handling and response. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is continuously integrated in the system (i.e., MISP, CVEs, STIX, etc.), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) are incorporated in the risk assessment and event evaluation processes. Several incident handling and response sub-procedures are automated, improving effectiveness and decreasing response time. Information concerning identified malicious activity is circulated back to the community (i.e., via the MISP information sharing platform) in an open loop. The proposal is applied in the supply-chain of healthcare organizations in Europe (considering also EU data protection regulations). Nevertheless, it is a generic solution that can be applied in any domain.",digitalization continue facilitate daily life world interconnect never bring close people business organization however hacker also come close new business operational model require collection processing massive amount data realtime involve utilization complex information system large supplychains personal device etc impose several advantage adversary one hand eg poorly protect monitor element slow fashion security updatesupgrades component gain little attention etc many difficulty defender hand eg administrate large complex system high dynamicity cybersecurity interplay impactful attack ict system critical infrastructure supply network well cyberwarfare derive necessity effective defensive paper present swarmintelligence solution incident handle response cyber threat intelligence cti continuously integrate system ie misp cf stix etc artificial intelligence aimachine learn ml incorporate risk assessment event evaluation process several incident handle response subprocedures automate improve effectiveness decrease response time information concern identify malicious activity circulate back community ie via misp information share platform open loop proposal apply supplychain healthcare organization europe consider also eu data protection regulation nevertheless generic solution apply domain,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755165849426027,0.0,0.1564450261056863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38488388873794727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16526291157311346,0.1074521328216053,0.0,0.0,0.17191033607273828,0.2880682900714395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793415244261171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4957887347193404,0.34382067214547657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877663109342243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621846338082826,0.0,0.1834134003456763,0.1418201572094341,0.0,0.0,0.12312810134452744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16849911727739852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16849911727739852,0.0,0.12644950919392722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178441904409818,0.16849911727739852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Epistemological Equation for Analysing Uncontrollable States in Complex Systems: Quantifying Cyber Risks from the Internet of Things,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12626-021-00086-5,22 July 2021,"Petar Radanliev, David De Roure, Pete Burnap, Omar Santos","The Internet-of-Things (IoT) triggers data protection questions and new types of cyber risks. Cyber risk regulations for the IoT, however, are still in their infancy. This is concerning, because companies integrating IoT devices and services need to perform a self-assessment of its IoT cyber security posture. At present, there are no self-assessment methods for quantifying IoT cyber risk posture. It is considered that IoT represent a complex system with too many uncontrollable risk states for quantitative risk assessment. To enable quantitative risk assessment of uncontrollable risk states in complex and coupled IoT systems, a new epistemological equation is designed and tested though comparative and empirical analysis. The comparative analysis is conducted on national digital strategies, followed by an empirical analysis of cyber risk assessment approaches. The results from the analysis present the current and a target state for IoT systems, followed by a transformation roadmap, describing how IoT systems can achieve the target state with a new epistemological analysis model. The new epistemological analysis approach enables the assessment of uncontrollable risk states in complex IoT systems—which begin to resemble artificial intelligence—and can be used for a quantitative self-assessment of IoT cyber risk posture.",internetofthings iot trigger data protection question new type cyber risk cyber risk regulation iot however still infancy concern company integrate iot device service need perform selfassessment iot cyber security posture present selfassessment method quantify iot cyber risk posture consider iot represent complex system many uncontrollable risk state quantitative risk assessment enable quantitative risk assessment uncontrollable risk state complex couple iot system new epistemological equation design test though comparative empirical analysis comparative analysis conduct national digital strategy follow empirical analysis cyber risk assessment approach result analysis present current target state iot system follow transformation roadmap describe iot system achieve target state new epistemological analysis model new epistemological analysis approach enables assessment uncontrollable risk state complex iot systemswhich begin resemble artificial intelligenceand use quantitative selfassessment iot cyber risk posture,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524209311517936,0.11398828348757782,0.0,0.072692673494818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23910765070941487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26701691387433657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059653776197906336,0.0777660705883242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06261511336947397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759632511666215,0.0,0.06717105756790759,0.0759632511666215,0.0,0.23494728743452908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13957258022558405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.072692673494818,0.0,0.6978629011279203,0.0,0.0523708508140133,0.0,0.0,0.31307556684736987,0.0,0.0647939179440389,0.0,0.15940510047294323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046119655286119506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Logical concept mapping and social media analytics relating to cyber criminal activities for ontology creation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-022-00934-9,02 May 2022,Romil Rawat,"The backbone of the semantic web is ontology, dealing with the context of details associated with a specific domain. Domain ontology (DO) is an important source of information for knowledge-based systems. Nonetheless, developing DO is a time-consuming procedure that is heavily reliant on the developer's expertise. Here, a novel semi-automated technique for creating Ontologies in the terrorism domain is suggested. Terrorism actions provide critical information that can be used to improve a country's security system. To obtain the most up-to-date knowledge of the domain, online social network (OSN) data, specifically Twitter text data, is retrieved, and then concepts and associated relationships are recognized and mapped through formal concept analysis (FCA). The fluent editor tool (FET) displays a number of user-defined associations. Knowledge is also extracted using a query-based approach and a reasoner window in the FET. The created DO is broadcast on the web using an ontology web language (OWL) that may be used in a variety of other applications. The suggested work is notable because it creates broad-coverage DO for the terrorist domain using a tool called Fluent Editor (FE) instead of the typical tool (protégé), and semantic information is retrieved with 100% correctness, similar to a query-based search system (QBS).",backbone semantic web ontology deal context detail associate specific domain domain ontology important source information knowledgebased system nonetheless develop timeconsuming procedure heavily reliant developer expertise novel semiautomated technique create ontology terrorism domain suggest terrorism action provide critical information use improve country security system obtain uptodate knowledge domain online social network osn data specifically twitter text data retrieve concept associate relationship recognize mapped formal concept analysis fca fluent editor tool fet display number userdefined association knowledge also extract use querybased approach reasoner window fet create broadcast web use ontology web language owl may use variety application suggest work notable creates broadcoverage terrorist domain use tool call fluent editor fe instead typical tool protg semantic information retrieve correctness similar querybased search system qbs,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10443163846260117,0.10133322533859353,0.0,0.0,0.2834156717186853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12169410168678149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2121238906600161,0.0,0.0,0.13505951686268353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6603056155318567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36508230506034445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13505951686268353,0.0,0.15389701154221716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132708026719162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09311320539866902,0.14170783585934266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4099941922676558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Analyzing influence operations on Facebook: an exploratory study,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-024-00093-0,29 May 2024,"Craig Douglas Albert, Lance Y. Hunter, Samantha Mullaney, Meagan Mays","Recently, there have been groundbreaking studies that seek to create unique cybersecurity datasets used to empirically test theories related to strategic cybersecurity. To date, however, this research has neglected cyber-enabled information operations (CEIO). With the remarkable amount of information operations being reported on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, there is a substantial gap in the literature regarding empirical studies on CEIO using cross-national datasets. This exploratory, descriptive study seeks to remedy this dilemma. To do so, this paper investigates the question, “What are the political and economic characteristics of states that are most likely to be targeted by CEIO over social media on Facebook?” To investigate, this exploratory, descriptive study utilizes a unique Information Operations Threat Report Dataset (2020) based on Facebook’s release of 2020 influence operations information that captures CEIO on its platform from 2017 to 2020. A descriptive data analysis reveals that mixed regimes (i.e., states that are partially authoritarian and democratic) and slightly wealthier states are more likely to be targeted in CEIO on Facebook. These exploratory findings provide useful insights into what types of states may be more susceptible to CEIO attacks on Facebook.",recently groundbreaking study seek create unique cybersecurity datasets use empirically test theory related strategic cybersecurity date however research neglect cyberenabled information operation ceio remarkable amount information operation report social medium platform facebook twitter instagram substantial gap literature regard empirical study ceio use crossnational datasets exploratory descriptive study seek remedy dilemma paper investigates question political economic characteristic state likely target ceio social medium facebook investigate exploratory descriptive study utilizes unique information operation threat report dataset base facebooks release influence operation information capture ceio platform descriptive data analysis reveals mixed regime ie state partially authoritarian democratic slightly wealthier state likely target ceio facebook exploratory finding provide useful insight type state may susceptible ceio attack facebook,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08769029101810692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967331452558168,0.0,0.11089051639769994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21259132264219738,0.08905924477346645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4087416935787167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11899077280590593,0.0,0.25101549918082783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4643989337821205,0.0761326122595098,0.0,0.11340824019241039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09348033039165843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08385002772563627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23798154561181187,0.0,0.3739213215666337,0.11089051639769994,0.0,0.34547100608138687,0.23798154561181187,0.0,0.11340824019241039,0.08148498975757996,0.0,0.0,0.13770734832838863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They have equipped with the most advanced malware and maintain a hidden attribution. The precocious cyber weapons, targeted and motivated with some specific intention are called as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Developing defense mechanisms and performing attribution analysis of such advanced attacks are extremely difficult due to the intricate design of attack vector and sophisticated malware employed with high stealth and evasive techniques. These attacks also include advanced zero-day and negative-day exploits and payloads. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the evolution of advanced malware design paradigms, APT attack vector and its anatomy, APT attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) and specific case studies on open-ended APT attacks. The survey covers a detailed discussion on APT attack phases and comparative study on threat life-cycle specification by various organizations. This work also addresses the APT attack attribution and countermeasures against these attacks from classical signature and heuristic based detection to modern machine learning and genetics based detection mechanisms along with sophisticated zero-day and negative day malware countermeasure by various techniques like monitoring of network traffic and DNS logs, moving target based defense, and attack graph based defenses.

This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to describe the plausible attack-defense dynamics for autonomous micro-grid. The game is a kind of two-player, one shot, non-cooperative, and Zero-sum game, where the goal of attackers in this game is to gain the maximum payoff under a certain cost. The behavior of attackers includes two steps, intrusion and disruption, whereas the defenders can improve their defense performance by updation or reinforcement of cyber component. The optimal strategy of attackers is deduced based on the dynamic model. Finally, the case studies validate the proposed method and demonstrate its feasibility.",security cyberphysical system cps become active research area recent year autonomous microgrid important component smart grid essentially cyberphysical system extends attack surface undermines system security paper proposes gametheoretic approach describe plausible attackdefense dynamic autonomous microgrid game kind twoplayer one shot noncooperative zerosum game goal attacker game gain maximum payoff certain cost behavior attacker include two step intrusion disruption whereas defender improve defense performance updation reinforcement cyber component optimal strategy attacker deduce base dynamic model finally case study validate propose method demonstrate feasibility,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1964827211450413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22337182246771292,0.0,0.2560633863050222,0.24545315389997457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3305329543279532,0.0,0.15341989025710762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23156682019114685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618772007013961,0.0,0.23156682019114685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17580199945593977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25060214714306794,0.0,0.0,0.24545315389997457,0.0,0.19362270768216713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3610885947849091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22337182246771292,0.19943652207854107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560633863050222

Two-stage advanced persistent threat (APT) attack on an IEC 61850 power grid substation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-024-00856-6,14 May 2024,"Aida Akbarzadeh, Laszlo Erdodi, Siv Hilde Houmb, Tore Geir Soltvedt","Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy, multi-step attacks tailored to a specific target. Often described as ’low and slow’, APTs remain undetected until the consequences of the cyber-attack become evident, usually in the form of damage to the physical world, as seen with the Stuxnet attack, or manipulation of an industrial process, as was the case in the Ukraine Power Grid attacks. Given the increasing sophistication and targeted nature of cyber-attacks, especially APTs, this paper delves into the substantial threats APTs pose to critical infrastructures, focusing on power grid substations. Through a detailed case study, we present and explore a 2-stage APT attack on an IEC 61850 power grid substation, employing a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testbed to simulate real-world conditions. More specifically, this paper discusses two significant experiments conducted to assess vulnerabilities in the control protocols used in IEC 61850 substations: IEC 60870-5-104 and IEC 61850. The integration of findings from these experiments revealed a number of previously undiscussed potential threats to power grid infrastructure that could arise from attacking one or more substations. To better address these potential threats, the paper proposes an extension to the Industrial Control System (ICS) kill chain that explicitly accounts for the consequences of attacks on the physical aspects of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).",advanced persistent threat apts stealthy multistep attack tailor specific target often described low slow apts remain undetected consequence cyberattack become evident usually form damage physical world see stuxnet attack manipulation industrial process case ukraine power grid attack give increase sophistication target nature cyberattacks especially apts paper delf substantial threat apts pose critical infrastructure focus power grid substation detailed case study present explore stage apt attack iec power grid substation employ hardwareintheloop hil testbed simulate realworld condition specifically paper discus two significant experiment conduct ass vulnerability control protocol use iec substation iec iec integration finding experiment reveal number previously undiscussed potential threat power grid infrastructure could arise attack one substation well address potential threat paper proposes extension industrial control system ic kill chain explicitly account consequence attack physical aspect cyberphysical system cps,0.09983242064886491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5777965009829895,0.0,0.0,0.21163811369440458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431316120829064,0.14249841539276722,0.10172724825044838,0.0,0.1215658060414532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10172724825044838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371928807315038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2273737551792995,0.0,0.0,0.49978001072133177,0.10371928807315038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08598049905619745,0.23691449294067093,0.0,0.0,0.3244785217452533,0.0,0.0,0.06854495065899188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Fear and empathy in international relations: Diplomacy, cyber engagement and Australian foreign policy",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41254-021-00211-9,21 April 2021,Luigi Di Martino,"Emotions in international relations, as in human relations, are invisible but leave traces in the policy articulation. Such traces can reveal how emotional interpretations of the environment in which national states operate shape and frame certain policy and strategic choices. Drawing on the concept of the “institutionalisation of empathy and fear” developed by Crawford (Int Theory 6(3):535–557, 2014), I first operationalise and then apply this concept to the Australian foreign policy. This framework is applied to the analysis of the foreign policy documents and strategies published by the Australian government in the last decade. In particular, I focus on Australia’s foreign policy articulation and interpretation of the internet and digital technologies. New, pressing problems are emerging in the digital environment due to a range of cybersecurity threats, including an increase in the frequency of automated accounts and the dissemination of fake news and digital propaganda. From perceiving the internet as a communication platform that allows for listeningtoand dialoguewithforeign publics, Australian foreign policy is increasingly framing the internet as strategic infrastructure that requires defending and guarding. The attention is, thus, moving towards short-term ‘defensive’ goals—as a result of a higher perceived fear of the latest evolution in the geopolitical context. The shift in Australian foreign policy indicates a form of institutionalisation of fear in response to the challenges emerging from the digital environment. I conclude by arguing that a more belligerent international environment highlights the tension between national interest—which evolves and changes due to political shifts and contextual elements—and the understanding of public diplomacy engagement as mutual understanding and mutual influence.",emotion international relation human relation invisible leave trace policy articulation trace reveal emotional interpretation environment national state operate shape frame certain policy strategic choice draw concept institutionalisation empathy fear developed crawford int theory first operationalise apply concept australian foreign policy framework apply analysis foreign policy document strategy publish australian government last decade particular focus australia foreign policy articulation interpretation internet digital technology new press problem emerge digital environment due range cybersecurity threat include increase frequency automate account dissemination fake news digital propaganda perceive internet communication platform allows listeningtoand dialoguewithforeign public australian foreign policy increasingly frame internet strategic infrastructure require defend guard attention thus move towards shortterm defensive goalsas result high perceive fear late evolution geopolitical context shift australian foreign policy indicates form institutionalisation fear response challenge emerge digital environment conclude argue belligerent international environment highlight tension national interestwhich evolves change due political shift contextual elementsand understand public diplomacy engagement mutual understand mutual influence,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07389689117338212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07389689117338212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0895756967578768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31510470414006464,0.0,0.0,0.19113897984288503,0.0,0.0,0.0861119859956145,0.08297867848017361,0.0,0.0,0.10889909304560658,0.09783761996994028,0.08450801684577622,0.0,0.08450801684577622,0.0877982451667355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19113897984288503,0.30871589964612256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07389689117338212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.701917357168003,0.09556948992144251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18290954165948978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09145477082974489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07877617603501616,0.18689559191242566,0.08151733361623843,0.0,0.0,0.06866766377975281,0.09556948992144251,0.06866766377975281,0.0,0.20054781633371513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An imperative of protecting critical information infrastructure (CII) is the theoretical basis for cybersecurity policies. The cyber competition has the potential to reshape global tech supply chains and international economic governance. The winner will make standards and rules that can take the most advantage of a first mover. The assumption that governments across jurisdictions embrace similar policies, regardless of their ideologies, is not a paradoxical proposition any more in the time of globalisation 2.0. Both the US and China use law enforcement power to advance their national strategic interests. The imposition of sanctions against Huawei is an epitome of the current US–China cyber competition game far beyond the mere economic scenario.

Digital twins enable systems’ analysis, design, optimisation, and evolution to be performed digitally or in conjunction with a cyber-physical approach to improve speed, accuracy, and efficiency over traditional engineering methods. Industry 4.0, factories of the future, and digital twins continue to benefit from the technology and provide enhanced efficiency within existing systems. Due to the lack of information and security standards associated with the transition to cyber digitisation, cybercriminals have been able to take advantage of the situation. Access to a digital twin of a product or service is equivalent to threatening the entire collection. There is a robust interaction between digital twins and artificial intelligence tools, which leads to strong interaction between these technologies, so it can be used to improve the cybersecurity of these digital platforms based on their integration with these technologies.

Formation of these designations and their counterparts often raises terminological issues that are important to deal with in order to develop a coherent system of the cyber domain terms. The given paper focuses on the terminology that includes the lexical itemcyberwhich may be considered as the main signifier of the cyber domain indicating its specific nature. The aim of the paper is threefold: to analyse the origin and development of the lexical itemcyber, to investigate conceptual categories of the EU legislation terminology that includes the lexical itemcyberand to establish the Lithuanian counterparts that are used for translation of the lexical itemcyberin the Lithuanian equivalents of the English terms. For the purposes of the study, the ad hoc English and Lithuanian corpora of the EU legislative documents were compiled. Corpus-driven methodology was used to extract and investigate the terminology used in the corpora. The results of the research are believed to provide useful information to learners and teachers of the legal language and legal translation, as well as drafters of legislative and administrative documents and other professionals engaged in cybersecurity matters.",cyber domain one new rapidly evolve field knowledge lead development new area lawcyber law regulates use internet activity perform internet network cyber domain particularly dynamic new concept constantly developed need new terminological designation turn need new counterpart language formation designation counterpart often raise terminological issue important deal order develop coherent system cyber domain term give paper focus terminology include lexical itemcyberwhich may consider main signifier cyber domain indicate specific nature aim paper threefold analyse origin development lexical itemcyber investigate conceptual category eu legislation terminology include lexical itemcyberand establish lithuanian counterpart use translation lexical itemcyberin lithuanian equivalent english term purpose study ad hoc english lithuanian corpus eu legislative document compile corpusdriven methodology use extract investigate terminology use corpus result research believe provide useful information learner teacher legal language legal translation well drafter legislative administrative document professional engage cybersecurity matter,0.0,0.0,0.10600756979652526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27040472742938726,0.0,0.0,0.10815366421162463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539056793249033,0.20794316215345204,0.0,0.0,0.45131534159240244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397158107672602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20406989859835367,0.0,0.0,0.10397158107672602,0.0,0.0,0.24849564450772985,0.11282883539810061,0.12107068083857184,0.11539056793249033,0.2713336182192585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23078113586498067,0.11539056793249033,0.4461153997971076,0.0,0.0,0.15492675579665383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09511432675535145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531569050009598,0.11042245757358886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787742303448572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802288282602846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In Society 5.0, decentralized autonomous cities and a convergence of physical and cyberspace are the foundations of the new chapter of society’s development. The idea of creating digital replicas and legitimate representatives of human beings in cyberspace has become a pillar of digitalization. Society 5.0 introduces Human Digital Twins as a central element of Cyber Physical Systems that include human factors or are designed to interact with humans in a personalized fashion. Overall, the HDT and neighboring concepts are applied to depict how humans can be represented in a cyberspace. However, there are clear challenges in determining which human characteristics should take precedence, how much autonomy should be granted to HDTs to optimize their functionality and how to conceptualize the digital environment in which HDTs interact with various entities, including other digital agents and stakeholders with agency and decisional power. To harness similarities and differences of current approaches, we propose a classification of HDTs based on meta-characteristics and ethical implications. We discuss ethical implication by focusing on emerging risks and paradigm shifts and anchor the previous discussion in the vision for Society 5.0, questioning whether societal development relying on disruptive technologies, instead of leading to more human-centered societies might be driving humanized societies away from humanity.",industry healthcare converge towards human center society technological advancement lever society decentralize autonomous city convergence physical cyberspace foundation new chapter society development idea create digital replica legitimate representative human being cyberspace become pillar digitalization society introduces human digital twin central element cyber physical system include human factor design interact human personalize fashion overall hdt neighbor concept apply depict human represent cyberspace however clear challenge determine human characteristic take precedence much autonomy grant hdts optimize functionality conceptualize digital environment hdts interact various entity include digital agent stakeholder agency decisional power harness similarity difference current approach propose classification hdts base metacharacteristics ethical implication discus ethical implication focus emerge risk paradigm shift anchor previous discussion vision society question whether societal development rely disruptive technology instead lead humancentered society might drive humanize society away humanity,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460512844998831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419573928520194,0.0,0.06658052573156882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0504457168502203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08815093666985617,0.0,0.0,0.15517246282865785,0.0,0.2839068941738236,0.0,0.0,0.08610736908996662,0.0,0.0,0.07758623141432892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5329874735658079,0.0,0.15228213530451654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08610736908996662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06658052573156882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529415234111113,0.0,0.0,0.08240003910608183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910553784725444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7086661024553416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06186903241284623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09271687696083965,0.0,0.0,0.0
An overview of cybercrime law in South Africa,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s43439-023-00089-8,02 June 2023,"Sizwe Snail ka Mtuze, Melody Musoni","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake and use of information communication technologies and led to the digital transformation of different sectors of the economy. For South Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic struck at a time when the South African government had committed itself to leveraging technology for the benefit of its citizens, the private sector, and the public sector. By 2020, South Africa already had in place enabling policy and legal frameworks to assist with the regulation of activities taking place in cyberspace. The increase in broadband access has resulted in the increase of internet users. Due to increase in use of digital technologies and processing of personal data, there has been an increase in cyber-attacks and cybercrimes such as data breaches, identity theft and cyber fraud. Several South African based companies, state owned entities, government departments and citizens have been victims of cyber-attacks. To respond to the growing spectre of cybercrime, the South African government promulgated laws to supplement the existing legal framework. It also operationalised some of the laws which had been passed but had not yet come into operation. This paper gives a summary of the evolution of cybercrime laws in South Africa. It starts off by summarising how common law and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act addressed cybercrime. The paper then proceeds to discuss the recently promulgated Cybercrimes Act, which is now the primary law criminalising certain online activities. It explores how the various provisions of the Cybercrimes Act address different types of cybercrimes known today. This discussion is aimed at demonstrating that South Africa is no longer a safe haven for cybercriminals.",covid pandemic accelerate uptake use information communication technology lead digital transformation different sector economy south africa covid pandemic struck time south african government commit leverage technology benefit citizen private sector public sector south africa already place enable policy legal framework assist regulation activity take place cyberspace increase broadband access result increase internet user due increase use digital technology processing personal data increase cyberattacks cybercrime data breach identity theft cyber fraud several south african base company state own entity government department citizen victim cyberattacks respond grow spectre cybercrime south african government promulgate law supplement exist legal framework also operationalised law pass yet come operation paper give summary evolution cybercrime law south africa start summarise common law electronic communication transaction act address cybercrime paper proceeds discus recently promulgate cybercrime act primary law criminalise certain online activity explores various provision cybercrime act address different type cybercrime know today discussion aim demonstrate south africa longer safe cybercriminals,0.12989541024233944,0.0,0.06747637384097847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718182738457043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04302978200381142,0.15817346854420655,0.6761966000696457,0.0,0.11535848938954148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15412881433139017,0.1210851240547436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07344887836293704,0.0,0.12754469794528206,0.0,0.0,0.25107959388029527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2699054953639139,0.0,0.06618041793653805,0.0,0.0,0.07908673427210328,0.0,0.38532203582847546,0.07344887836293704,0.17271038939700456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369319796009843,0.07519202471833113,0.09861461508994666,0.07706440716569508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07028655634665153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07028655634665153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0605425620273718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15832132896927345,0.0,0.0,0.06747637384097847,0.0,0.089186202518389,0.07908673427210328,0.0,0.0,0.0

Port cyberattacks from 2011 to 2023: a literature review and discussion of selected cases,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41278-023-00276-8,06 December 2023,Chalermpong Senarak,"Cyberattacks pose a significant threat to seaports worldwide. While numerous scholars have endeavored to address these threats, their findings are often limited in practicality, applying to only a few ports. This paper aims to contribute to the extant literature by presenting and discussing 15 case studies of port cyberattacks that occurred from 2011 to 2023. These cases encompass six instances in Europe, six in America, two in Asia, and one in Africa. The study employs a twofold methodology, consisting of a comprehensive literature review and a personal assessment. Several key insights emerge. First, two primary motivations drive port cyberattacks: (a) the demand for ransom payments and (b) the desire to cause severe disruptions. Second, ransomware was the most common threat used to extort payments, followed by malware and DDoS attacks, which aimed to inflict operational disruption. Third, weaknesses in cybersecurity procedures and a lack of awareness among staff members emerged as significant contributors to cyber vulnerabilities. Forth, ports that quickly detected threats and implemented response measures were able to minimize operational impacts, ensuring the swift resumption of services and the maintenance of service continuity. Fifth, collaborative efforts with external partners and officials expedited response and recovery processes by facilitating threat investigation and solution identification. In light of these findings, it becomes imperative for all ports to develop comprehensive cyber disaster management plans, covering four key phases: preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. These plans should encompass three critical aspects of cybersecurity hygiene: human factors, procedural improvements, and infrastructure enhancements. Such practices are instrumental in bolstering a port’s resilience and mitigating the risks associated with cyberattacks.",cyberattacks pose significant threat seaport worldwide numerous scholar endeavor address threat finding often limited practicality apply port paper aim contribute extant literature present discuss case study port cyberattacks occur case encompass six instance europe six america two asia one africa study employ twofold methodology consist comprehensive literature review personal assessment several key insight emerge first two primary motivation drive port cyberattacks demand ransom payment b desire cause severe disruption second ransomware common threat use extort payment follow malware ddos attack aim inflict operational disruption third weakness cybersecurity procedure lack awareness among staff member emerge significant contributor cyber vulnerability forth port quickly detect threat implement response measure able minimize operational impact ensure swift resumption service maintenance service continuity fifth collaborative effort external partner official expedite response recovery process facilitate threat investigation solution identification light finding becomes imperative port develop comprehensive cyber disaster management plan cover four key phase preparedness response recovery mitigation plan encompass three critical aspect cybersecurity hygiene human factor procedural improvement infrastructure enhancement practice instrumental bolster port resilience mitigate risk associate cyberattacks,0.11096912091614268,0.0,0.23057916746320073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13167161951521236,0.10704199658749923,0.0,0.0,0.23524717998797476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307532400997451,0.14704067136068227,0.5405078046671905,0.0,0.23524717998797476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12549415639868602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25098831279737205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096912091614268,0.10704199658749923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633432390304247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424606478088036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11528958373160036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13167161951521236,0.11528958373160036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1911439256743285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45084422575615524,0.0,0.0,0.07619141024960399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of AI-driven cyberattacks, offering insights into their implications, mitigation strategies, underlying motivations, and profound societal impacts. The research centres on developing and presenting the AI Cybersecurity Dimensions (AICD) Framework, a comprehensive, multidimensional schema designed to guide academics, policymakers, and industry professionals in understanding and combating the evolving challenges posed by AI-driven cyber threats. The research unveils the complex dynamics of offensive AI, stressing the need for adaptive defences and ethical considerations. Concurrently, the study highlights adversarial AI threats, calling for proactive measures to address their potential ramifications. Through rigorous textual analyses and extensive literature reviews, the paper underscores the urgency for interdisciplinary approaches to bridge the technology-humanity chasm traditionally observed in cybersecurity discussions. By synthesising these diverse elements, the AICD Framework emerges as an instrumental tool for holistic understanding and practical interventions in the AI-infused cybersecurity landscape.

The financials of cybercrime: a health insurance pricing approach,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42786-022-00039-8,27 April 2022,"Thomas Poufinas, Nikolaos Vordonis","The expansion of information technology in everyday reality through the spread of social networks and mobile devices, emerging technologies -such as cloud services and the internet of things, has led to increased vulnerability for individuals and businesses. Individuals can suffer fraud, identity theft, embarrassment and distress when critical information (such as financial or sensitive personal data) is compromised or even publicly revealed, as a result of a cybercrime. The increase of cyber-risks impacts both individuals and entities, such as businesses and governments and renders cyber-insurance -on top of other cyber security means- more necessary with the passage of time. In this paper, it is assumed that multiple cyber-incidents are possible during the (digital) life of an individual. They resemble to illness that can affect the physical life of an individual. Illness as opposed to fatality—which has been used in research so far- can occur several times within the lifetime of an individual and the same can happen during his or her digital life, as he or she may suffer several cyber-attacks (digital illnesses) and yet digitally survive.

A History of Malaria and Conflict,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00436-024-08167-4,20 March 2024,Jonas E. Mertens,"It is supposed that in all armed conflicts until World War II more humans died of infectious diseases than of the actual violence. Especially malaria left a crucial imprint on wars throughout history. The disease aggravates wartime conditions, is thus responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in conflict zones, and is at the same time more commonly found in these areas. Malaria has halted many military campaigns in the past, with prominent examples ranging from antiquity through the medieval period and into the modern era. The parasitosis still continues to play an important role in the outcome of warfare and follow-up events today and is of special public health importance in areas of the Global South, where most of its endemicity and some of the most brutal conflicts of our time are located. Vice versa, wars and ensuing population movements increase malaria transmission and morbidity as well as impede control efforts. Awareness of this and the development of strategies to overcome both malaria and wars will massively improve the well-being of the population affected.",suppose arm conflict world war ii human die infectious disease actual violence especially malaria left crucial imprint war throughout history disease aggravates wartime condition thus responsible significant morbidity mortality conflict zone time commonly found area malaria halt many military campaign past prominent example range antiquity medieval period modern era parasitosis still continue play important role outcome warfare followup event today special public health importance area global south endemicity brutal conflict time locate vice versa war ensue population movement increase malaria transmission morbidity well impede control effort awareness development strategy overcome malaria war massively improve wellbeing population affected,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5134287506297077,0.18000757979682586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15063179649966646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850112977700764,0.0,0.0,0.14782604592061827,0.0,0.0,0.15358149328546503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15997768799864107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15997768799864107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16346399657459387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425945792157435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30716298657093005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6267628353634997,0.12731492554371548,0.0

This paper argues that such an unrealistic assumption can be relaxed: the adversary might still be able to identify the system model by passively observing the control input and sensory data. In such a setup, the attack with knowledge of input-output data can be categorized as a Known-Plaintext Attack. A necessary and sufficient condition has been provided, under which the adversary can uniquely obtain the knowledge of the underlying physical system. From the defender’s perspective, a secure controller design—which exhibits a low rank structure—is proposed which renders the system unidentifiable to the adversary, while trading off the control system’s performance. Finally, a numerical example has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed secure controller design.",surge interest security cyberphysical system cps yet commonly assume adversary full knowledge physical system model paper argues unrealistic assumption relaxed adversary might still able identify system model passively observe control input sensory data setup attack knowledge inputoutput data categorize knownplaintext attack necessary sufficient condition provide adversary uniquely obtain knowledge underlie physical system defender perspective secure controller designwhich exhibit low rank structureis propose render system unidentifiable adversary trading control system performance finally numerical example provide demonstrate effectiveness propose secure controller design,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3550163012410853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4481630755271584,0.2626664938921739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3268526376061289,0.21304640634761918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3680410317031075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13970557008518028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3982948537507052,0.3430782804247293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434741588315251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Adopting AI: how familiarity breeds both trust and contempt,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-023-01666-5,12 May 2023,"Michael C. Horowitz, Lauren Kahn, Julia Macdonald, Jacquelyn Schneider","Despite pronouncements about the inevitable diffusion of artificial intelligence and autonomous technologies, in practice, it is human behavior, not technology in a vacuum, that dictates how technology seeps into—and changes—societies. To better understand how human preferences shape technological adoption and the spread of AI-enabled autonomous technologies, we look at representative adult samples of US public opinion in 2018 and 2020 on the use of four types of autonomous technologies: vehicles, surgery, weapons, and cyber defense. By focusing on these four diverse uses of AI-enabled autonomy that span transportation, medicine, and national security, we exploit the inherent variation between these AI-enabled autonomous use cases. We find that those with familiarity and expertise with AI and similar technologies were more likely to support all of the autonomous applications we tested (except weapons) than those with a limited understanding of the technology. Individuals that had already delegated the act of driving using ride-share apps were also more positive about autonomous vehicles. However, familiarity cut both ways; individuals are also less likely to support AI-enabled technologies when applied directly to their life, especially if technology automates tasks they are already familiar with operating. Finally, we find that familiarity plays little role in support for AI-enabled military applications, for which opposition has slightly increased over time.",despite pronouncement inevitable diffusion artificial intelligence autonomous technology practice human behavior technology vacuum dictate technology seeps intoand changessocieties well understand human preference shape technological adoption spread aienabled autonomous technology look representative adult sample u public opinion use four type autonomous technology vehicle surgery weapon cyber defense focus four diverse us aienabled autonomy span transportation medicine national security exploit inherent variation aienabled autonomous use case find familiarity expertise ai similar technology likely support autonomous application test except weapon limited understand technology individual already delegate act drive use rideshare apps also positive autonomous vehicle however familiarity cut way individual also less likely support aienabled technology apply directly life especially technology automates task already familiar operating finally find familiarity play little role support aienabled military application opposition slightly increase time,0.0,0.1329927830574687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499772289841116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11263492391633778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07040218221601754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082795595452389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21252536998898836,0.0,0.0,0.1103999078128703,0.2825761074934157,0.0,0.11263492391633778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12302369147355541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499772289841116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499772289841116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11750380704409018,0.08284918273494585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77710133761237,0.0,0.0,0.1103999078128703,0.2521742933844314,0.2188799125323748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
How to witness a drone strike,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-022-00048-3,29 September 2022,Michael Richardson,"Witnessing is crucial to public engagement with war, but the remote violence of drones presents distinct challenges: its victims are largely invisible to Western publics; operations are cloaked in secrecy; and promises of precision targeting, accurate surveillance, and legal monitoring obscure the brutalities of the system. With so many barriers to witnessing, remote warfare tends to remain on the periphery of political debate and has not occasioned widespread resistance. Yet the means for witnessing drone warfare exist; the question is how they might be leveraged to make remote war more accessible and contestable. This article analyses the high-profile drone strike that killed 10 civilians in Kabul on 29 August 2021 to consider the limits and possibilities of witnessing drone strikes, alongside the database of conflict monitor Airwars and the aesthetic practice of the research agency Forensic Architecture. It argues that witnessing drone strikes requires assembling new conceptual techniques with long-standing practices of media witnessing and human rights testimony. It is not a manual or primer but rather maps four critical, analytical, and ethico-political trajectories demanded by the problem of how to witness a drone strike: lived experiences, violent mediations, infrastructural scales, and aesthetics.",witness crucial public engagement war remote violence drone present distinct challenge victim largely invisible western public operation cloaked secrecy promise precision target accurate surveillance legal monitoring obscure brutality system many barrier witness remote warfare tends remain periphery political debate occasion widespread resistance yet mean witness drone warfare exist question might leveraged make remote war accessible contestable article analysis highprofile drone strike kill civilian kabul august consider limit possibility witness drone strike alongside database conflict monitor airwars aesthetic practice research agency forensic architecture argues witness drone strike require assemble new conceptual technique longstanding practice medium witness human right testimony manual primer rather map four critical analytical ethicopolitical trajectory demand problem witness drone strike live experience violent mediation infrastructural scale aesthetic,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787350853083859,0.0,0.09252293683021945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787350853083859,0.0,0.0,0.10310256104671504,0.0,0.0,0.09074593490412494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7947377948973048,0.0,0.0,0.10071237599459525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08905565127663014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184093893794659,0.0,0.0,0.09847650719852528,0.11145736540431028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787350853083859,0.0,0.10310256104671504,0.0,0.0,0.10071237599459525,0.0,0.09252293683021945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1927524626086397,0.0,0.3552281681383977,0.07446315633797007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566995335069004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1887920770378214,0.15339805026808007,0.0

Despite the development the Internet has brought to humanity, the Government of Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) has not lost sight of the fact that the use of ICTs and other related supporting devices are fraught with cybercrime and cyber insecurities that constitute challenges to global law enforcement agencies in PNG and other nations of the world. This paper reports the trends on victims of cybercrimes from 2001 to 2021 and presents an action plan for PNG. The data analysed in this study was explicated from the Internet crime reports published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and National White Collar Crime Center (IC3). The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and XGraph component of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences’ Population Pyramid. The results confirmed that the number of Internet users that were defrauded increased exponentially from 2016 to 2021. Results from the data explicated from the World Bank on Internet use, revealed that the population of Internet users in PNG and Australia will increase at a minimum rate of 1% to 2% for the next few years. These findings suggest that cybercrimes will be on the rise as the number of Internet users increase at 1% to 2% in PNG and Australia in the next few years.

Open-source intelligence and great-power competition under mediatization,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41284-024-00446-0,12 September 2024,Jiaxi Zhou,"With the rise of mediatization, open-source intelligence (OSINT) has evolved into a decentralized form of intelligence gathering, influenced by both political and commercial logic. This transformation has positioned social media as a primary source of OSINT, enhancing the capabilities of non-state actors and significantly impacting international politics, particularly in the realm of great-power competition. Through an analysis spanning individual, state, and systemic levels, this article examines OSINT’s role in shaping contemporary international politics. By exploring case studies such as the Russo-Ukrainian War, Israel-Hamas War, and strategic competition between China and the United States, this article illuminates how OSINT influences decision-making processes and global power struggles and contributes to a deeper understanding of the evolving landscape of intelligence and its implications for statecraft.",rise mediatization opensource intelligence osint evolve decentralize form intelligence gathering influence political commercial logic transformation position social medium primary source osint enhance capability nonstate actor significantly impact international politics particularly realm greatpower competition analysis span individual state systemic level article examines osints role shape contemporary international politics explore case study russoukrainian war israelhamas war strategic competition china united state article illuminates osint influence decisionmaking process global power struggle contributes deeper understand evolve landscape intelligence implication statecraft,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277615160942757,0.0,0.3035915783412421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1548688536319606,0.0,0.17791461749342627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16523161841912792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18286015684382842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14093662081585542,0.0,0.0,0.19426584717095552,0.0,0.46460656089588176,0.33046323683825585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18286015684382842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16523161841912792,0.18286015684382842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16156338781589707,0.0,0.17336516230483195,0.0,0.2723947793346007,0.16156338781589707,0.0,0.125834624880133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17336516230483195,0.0,0.0,0.3097377072639212,0.0,0.0
Why converging technologies need converging international regulation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09756-8,28 February 2024,"Dirk Helbing, Marcello Ienca","Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, gene editing, nanotechnology, neurotechnology and robotics, which were originally unrelated or separated, are becoming more closely integrated. Consequently, the boundaries between the physical-biological and the cyber-digital worlds are no longer well defined. We argue that this technological convergence has fundamental implications for individuals and societies. Conventional domain-specific governance mechanisms have become ineffective. In this paper we provide an overview of the ethical, societal and policy challenges of technological convergence. Particularly, we scrutinize the adequacy of domain-specific governance mechanisms in the face of such integrated technologies and highlight their growing ineffectiveness. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive governance framework that is anticipatory, inclusive, and resilient. Central to this framework is the principle of participatory governance, which calls for a proactive engagement of all stakeholders, including those from marginalized and vulnerable populations, ensuring that their voices and concerns shape the trajectory of technological development. The framework emphasizes the need for protective measures that preemptively address potential risks and inequities that may arise from the adoption and integration of emerging technologies. Based on a detailed analysis of case studies and current governance models, we present and discuss a set of ten actionable recommendations. These are designed to facilitate the transition towards a governance approach that not only respects individual autonomy and privacy, but also fosters a collective responsibility towards sustainable and fair technological progress. By placing human dignity, societal welfare and the protection of the most vulnerable at the center of technological innovation, we advocate for a future where convergence is synonymous with progress that is both ethically grounded and universally beneficial.",emerge technology artificial intelligence gene edit nanotechnology neurotechnology robotics originally unrelated separate become closely integrate consequently boundary physicalbiological cyberdigital world longer well define argue technological convergence fundamental implication individual society conventional domainspecific governance mechanism become ineffective paper provide overview ethical societal policy challenge technological convergence particularly scrutinize adequacy domainspecific governance mechanism face integrate technology highlight grow ineffectiveness furthermore propose comprehensive governance framework anticipatory inclusive resilient central framework principle participatory governance call proactive engagement stakeholder include marginalize vulnerable population ensure voice concern shape trajectory technological development framework emphasizes need protective measure preemptively address potential risk inequity may arise adoption integration emerge technology base detailed analysis case study current governance model present discus set ten actionable recommendation design facilitate transition towards governance approach respect individual autonomy privacy also foster collective responsibility towards sustainable fair technological progress place human dignity societal welfare protection vulnerable center technological innovation advocate future convergence synonymous progress ethically ground universally beneficial,0.13546242650511936,0.0,0.0,0.11845328482621233,0.11493885933514059,0.0,0.14659775053857566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14979247726148198,0.14358568206437824,0.11845328482621233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568291612948464,0.0,0.0,0.13803351456500096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063869083152484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.399032904379684,0.1568291612948464,0.0,0.0,0.1568291612948464,0.13546242650511936,0.0,0.13546242650511936,0.0,0.3602247128934571,0.0,0.14358568206437824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13546242650511936,0.1531934541576242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284100896275011,0.1607344181348274,0.0,0.0,0.14073650970750237,0.18011235644672854,0.14659775053857566,0.1262745518685199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14073650970750237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18011235644672854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11666677977527393,0.0,0.3302132284686762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

While investigative journalism and open-source intelligence have immensely benefited from leaked email data, academia has largely distanced itself from this novel type of reference and related empirical findings. Initial scholarly endeavors utilizing leaked emails highlight two key issues: 1) the authenticity of leaked data and the specifics of its interpretation and verification; and 2) research ethics concerning the privacy of leaked email account holders. I argue that traceability and ethical dilemmas should be addressed in tandem, considering the wider public good.

The consensus still is that little can be done to prosecute the perpetrators – and unfortunately, this might be right in many cases. What is however only of limited interest for the private industry is in the center of interest for nation states. Investigating if an attack was carried out in the name of a nation state is a crucial task for secret services. Many methods, tools and processes exist for network- and computer forensics that allow the collection of traces and evidences. They are the basis to associate adversarial actions to threat actors. However, a serious problem which has not got the appropriate attention from research yet, are false flag campaigns, cyber attacks which apply covert tactics to deceive or misguide attribution attempts – either to hide traces or to blame others. In this paper we provide an overview of prominent attack techniques along the cyber kill chain. We investigate traces left by attack techniques and which questions in course of the attribution process are answered by investigating these traces. Eventually, we assess how easily traces can be spoofed and rate their relevancy with respect to identifying false flag campaigns.",attribution cyber attack often neglect consensus still little do prosecute perpetrator unfortunately might right many case however limited interest private industry center interest nation state investigate attack carry name nation state crucial task secret service many method tool process exist network computer forensics allow collection trace evidence basis associate adversarial action threat actor however serious problem get appropriate attention research yet false flag campaign cyber attack apply covert tactic deceive misguide attribution attempt either hide trace blame others paper provide overview prominent attack technique along cyber kill chain investigate trace left attack technique question course attribution process answer investigate trace eventually ass easily trace spoofed rate relevancy respect identify false flag campaign,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18793845855758606,0.7639196629330129,0.0,0.0,0.16788732663021227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31481268198732665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17912119861811845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17912119861811845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17912119861811845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12024668347480875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14764631563423344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13243585690860205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2952926312684669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870042785250463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty to constrain the risk of war from a militarised artificial superintelligence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-021-01382-y,11 January 2022,"Elias G. Carayannis, John Draper","This article argues that an artificial superintelligence (ASI) emerging in a world where war is still normalised constitutes a catastrophic existential risk, either because the ASI might be employed by a nation–state to war for global domination, i.e., ASI-enabled warfare, or because the ASI wars on behalf of itself to establish global domination, i.e., ASI-directed warfare. Presently, few states declare war or even war on each other, in part due to the 1945 UN Charter, which states Member States should “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force”, while allowing for UN Security Council-endorsed military measures and self-defense. As UN Member States no longer declare war on each other, instead, only ‘international armed conflicts’ occur. However, costly interstate conflicts, both hot and cold and tantamount to wars, still take place. Further, a New Cold War between AI superpowers looms. An ASI-directed/enabled future conflict could trigger total war, including nuclear conflict, and is therefore high risk. Via conforming instrumentalism, an international relations theory, we advocate risk reduction by optimising peace through a Universal Global Peace Treaty (UGPT), contributing towards the ending of existing wars and prevention of future wars, as well as a Cyberweapons and Artificial Intelligence Convention. This strategy could influence state actors, including those developing ASIs, or an agential ASI, particularly if it values conforming instrumentalism and peace.",article argues artificial superintelligence asi emerge world war still normalise constitutes catastrophic existential risk either asi might employ nationstate war global domination ie asienabled warfare asi war behalf establish global domination ie asidirected warfare presently state declare war even war part due un charter state member state refrain international relation threat use force allow un security councilendorsed military measure selfdefense un member state longer declare war instead international arm conflict occur however costly interstate conflict hot cold tantamount war still take place new cold war ai superpower loom asidirectedenabled future conflict could trigger total war include nuclear conflict therefore high risk via conform instrumentalism international relation theory advocate risk reduction optimise peace universal global peace treaty ugpt contribute towards end exist war prevention future war well cyberweapons artificial intelligence convention strategy could influence state actor include develop asis agential asi particularly value conform instrumentalism peace,0.0,0.07996787165076998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06638289278014065,0.13829507035576716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2958940340547665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07225861052757689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07225861052757689,0.0,0.07225861052757689,0.0,0.0,0.14794701702738325,0.2399036149523099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12779040425425095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772679638746841,0.2167758315827307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06914753517788358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05587229442037767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19914867834042194,0.0,0.0498167844826319,0.0,0.0,0.2978072305107554,0.0,0.06163399287643092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07225861052757689,0.05191855661234927,0.0,0.0,0.0438704525912938,0.0,0.7449947602621525,0.11005926392408517,0.0
U.S. strategy of damage limitation vis-à-vis China: long-term programs and effects,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42533-024-00153-w,25 April 2024,"Bin Li, Riqiang Wu","A number of U.S. military programs, if successfully developed and deployed, could undermine China's nuclear retaliatory capabilities, thereby enhancing U.S. damage limitation capabilities vis-à-vis China. Meanwhile, China seeks to maintain the credibility of its nuclear retaliatory capabilities and increase the survivability and penetration of its nuclear weapons. These interactions are part of the nuclear competition between the United States and China. This article discusses three cases: the U.S. homeland missile defense system, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) preparations, and the space-based Ground Moving Target Indicator. These programs may serve declaratory purposes in one way or another, but their development has had a negative impact on China’s strategic nuclear retaliatory capabilities. Using non-nuclear means that differ technologically from the measures taken by China, these programs have created an asymmetric competition between the two sides. These U.S. programs have endured for several decades, and have continued to introduce new technologies despite occasional interruptions. The main element of development in these programs has been qualitative improvement, while quantitative increases have not always been evident.

The prominent human element and the dynamic, networked and multi-type nature of cyber risk are perhaps what makes it uniquely challenging. Complementary top-down statistical and bottom-up analytical approaches are discussed. Focusing on data breach severity, we exploit open data for events at organisations in the U.S. We show that this extremely heavy-tailed risk is worsening for external attacker ‘hack’ events. Writing in Q2 of 2018, the median predicted number of ids breached in the U.S. due to hacking in the last 6 months of 2018 was 0.5 billion, with a 5% chance that the figure exceeds 7 billion, doubling the historical total. ‘Fortunately’, the total breach in that period turned out to be near the median.",consider data breach manmade catastrophe help clarify actuarial need multiple level analysisgoing beyond claimsdriven loss statistic aloneand call specific advance data model prominent human element dynamic networked multitype nature cyber risk perhaps make uniquely challenge complementary topdown statistical bottomup analytical approach discuss focus data breach severity exploit open data event organisation u show extremely heavytailed risk worsen external attacker hack event write q median predict number id breach u due hack last month billion chance figure exceeds billion double historical total fortunately total breach period turn near median,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717714121070655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17702357689135528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13412452271220737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7191485343245755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20628542733138486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024430416556254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2238587148946391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024430416556254,0.2289413354058664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4206498854663068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Since the rise of the internet in the late 1990s, a number of approaches to technology regulation have been proposed, prompted by the associated changes in society, business and law that this development brought with it. However, over the past decade, the impact of technology has been profound and the associated issues for government have extremely challenging, ranging across cyber security, artificial intelligence, and many other areas. To that end, this article introduces a Theory of Institutional Technology Actors and Norms (TITAN), a normatively informed and institutionally-based account of technology regulation. It focuses on the moral and legal (including regulatory) rights and responsibilities of the relevant actors and seeks to inform the development of regulation that is both fit for purpose, rights compliant and fair for all concerned. The account incorporates the perspectives of four key categories of groups in society: producers of technology, users of technology, government regulators, and normative policy shapers.",technology regulation one important public policy issue face society government present time clarity could improve decision make complex challenge area since rise internet late number approach technology regulation propose prompt associate change society business law development brought however past decade impact technology profound associate issue government extremely challenge range across cyber security artificial intelligence many area end article introduces theory institutional technology actor norm titan normatively inform institutionallybased account technology regulation focus moral legal include regulatory right responsibility relevant actor seek inform development regulation fit purpose right compliant fair concerned account incorporates perspective four key category group society producer technology user technology government regulator normative policy shaper,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173965983413506,0.10008585865805278,0.10425412546102251,0.22861505217603262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1684779414714498,0.0,0.11430752608801631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382489802830582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19632720546416244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816360273208122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37241949017958853,0.0,0.0,0.09292591571736003,0.0963351535493245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10211206964193587,0.0,0.11730718853889624,0.21305216021614998,0.11430752608801631,0.0,0.1280882969697175,0.0,0.0,0.10652608010807499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22861505217603262,0.0,0.0,0.10008585865805278,0.0,0.10425412546102251,0.0,0.10425412546102251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751090445401468,0.0,0.38426489090915245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5479452869326862,0.10894471116290246,0.0,0.10008585865805278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Reactive handover coordination system with regenerative blockchain principles for swarm unmanned aerial vehicles,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-023-01572-z,26 October 2023,"S. Rajasoundaran, S. V. N. Santhosh Kumar, M. Selvi, Arputharaj Kannan","Aerial warfare systems in various countries highly expect Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Flying Adhoc Networks (FANETs) for defense stability. However, swarm UAVs face many challenges, like security breaches, malfunctions, link failures, and handover failures. UAVs can easily malfunction by external threats to create data loss, theft, signal jamming, misrouting, false handover, and location spoofing. Failures in UAV handover principles make overall gradual downtime in FANET. Against these issues, existing UAV protection mechanisms deliver location monitoring mechanisms (graphs and trees), multi-link handover mechanisms, and distributed authentication principles. However, the implantation of recent-day techniques may fail against migrating attacker events executed in electronic warfare systems. The existing security methods need improvements for protecting Multi-UAV layers effectively through end-to-end security principles. For this purpose, a new Reactive Handover Coordination System with Regenerative Blockchain (RHCRB) Principles is proposed that takes novel high-security features specially made for swarm UAVs. The proposed RHCRB implements more crucial distributed functions in each UAV on demand. The executed operations of RHCRB comprise trusted location monitoring schemes (internal and cooperative UAV movements), dynamic location-based cost magnitude calculations, regenerative blockchain principles (authentication of each UAV and active edges), confidential link management principles, secure handover coordination, and on-demand topology management principles. The technical aspects of RHCRB build lightweight and shielded handover principles against airfield vulnerabilities. The proposed model suggests implementing an entirely protected handover environment from node localization to handover events. The inspired technical aspects of RHCRB contribute to the swarm UAV environment through confidentiality using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and distributed authentication (blockchain-based node and edge management) principles to engage protected handover practices. The experimental section of this article has been tested using testbed in FlyNetSim tool for implementing RHCRB and notable recent security techniques such as the Internet of Vehicles with Decentralized Blockchains (IoV-DB), Group Handover for Internet of Defense (GH-IoD), and Handover and Optimized Security Principles for UAVs (HOOPOE). The results obtained by this system show RHCRB's 8% to 14% of betterment than existing techniques through various measures.",aerial warfare system various country highly expect swarm unmanned aerial vehicle uavs fly adhoc network fanets defense stability however swarm uavs face many challenge like security breach malfunction link failure handover failure uavs easily malfunction external threat create data loss theft signal jamming misrouting false handover location spoof failure uav handover principle make overall gradual downtime fanet issue exist uav protection mechanism deliver location monitoring mechanism graph tree multilink handover mechanism distribute authentication principle however implantation recentday technique may fail migrate attacker event execute electronic warfare system exist security method need improvement protect multiuav layer effectively endtoend security principle purpose new reactive handover coordination system regenerative blockchain rhcrb principle propose take novel highsecurity feature specially make swarm uavs propose rhcrb implement crucial distribute function uav demand execute operation rhcrb comprise trust location monitoring scheme internal cooperative uav movement dynamic locationbased cost magnitude calculation regenerative blockchain principle authentication uav active edge confidential link management principle secure handover coordination ondemand topology management principle technical aspect rhcrb build lightweight shield handover principle airfield vulnerability propose model suggests implement entirely protect handover environment node localization handover event inspire technical aspect rhcrb contribute swarm uav environment confidentiality use advanced encryption standard aes distribute authentication blockchainbased node edge management principle engage protect handover practice experimental section article test use testbed flynetsim tool implement rhcrb notable recent security technique internet vehicle decentralize blockchains iovdb group handover internet defense ghiod handover optimize security principle uavs hoopoe result obtain system show rhcrbs betterment exist technique various measure,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06578794294058561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055371544736101785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05623596294279804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21483300051860843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15421556510763854,0.07002119753778446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14004239507556893,0.0,0.07161100017286946,0.0,0.06332254795883285,0.07161100017286946,0.07161100017286946,0.055371544736101785,0.0,0.07331052856240648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8419436756985408,0.20558342254673445,0.0,0.0,0.06711980195024564,0.0,0.0,0.06852780751557816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2468515334124834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051453241895969705,0.0,0.0,0.08695453635660581,0.15421556510763854,0.0,0.10907286910652204,0.0

Drawing on data between 2017 and 2023 and strategic decisions, such as bans and export controls directed at China’s companies and the changing alignment posture of Western states, we employ the Balance of Threat (BoT) theory to examine China’s changing aggregate power, offensive capabilities and aggressive intentions, while also establishing the vanishing importance of the geographic dimension. We then turn to the behavior of the US and Western states by drawing on the BoT theory, which suggests balancing as a prime strategy to counter the threat and identify instances of the formation of a balancing coalition against China. We demonstrate how the notion of threat in ETs can be approached and conclude with a characterization of balancing in the domain of ETs that resonates with the notion of “gradual balancing”, in addition to outlining suggestions for future studies.",last year china united state america u engage unprecedented competition emerge technology ets context china grow presence shift position international system draw data strategic decision ban export control direct china company change alignment posture western state employ balance threat bot theory examine china change aggregate power offensive capability aggressive intention also establish vanish importance geographic dimension turn behavior u western state draw bot theory suggests balance prime strategy counter threat identify instance formation balance coalition china demonstrate notion threat ets approach conclude characterization balance domain ets resonates notion gradual balance addition outline suggestion future study,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10112217977734714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.725618300386639,0.0,0.0,0.1451236600773278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10584105131716812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178608090030633,0.0,0.13477822993588626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379768925368084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13477822993588626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491577005721361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3332856618522696,0.13178608090030633,0.1149609770118139,0.10264238871624598,0.0,0.09683954770162656,0.2695564598717725,0.2905186431048797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178608090030633

The present study connects to this nascent research area by charting A.I. news frames in four internationally renowned media outlets:The New York Times,The Guardian,Wired, andGizmodo. The main goals are to identify dominant emphasis frames in AI news reporting over the past decade, to explore whether certain A.I. frames are associated with specific data risks (surveillance, data bias, cyber-war/cyber-crime, and information disorder), and what journalists and experts contribute to the media discourse. An automated content analysis serves for inductive frame detection (N= 3098), identification of risk references (dictionary-based), and network analysis of news writers. The results show how A.I.’s ubiquity emerged rapidly in the mid-2010s, and that the news discourse became more critical over time. It is further argued that A.I. news reporting is an important factor in building critical data literacy among lay audiences.",analyse news medium portray ai reveals interpretative framework around technology circulate public discourse allows critical reflection make meaning prevalent narrative ai impact research public perception datafication automation grow study investigate news frame practice present study connects nascent research area chart ai news frame four internationally renowned medium outletsthe new york timesthe guardianwired andgizmodo main goal identify dominant emphasis frame ai news reporting past decade explore whether certain ai frame associate specific data risk surveillance data bias cyberwarcybercrime information disorder journalist expert contribute medium discourse automate content analysis serf inductive frame detection n identification risk reference dictionarybased network analysis news writer result show ai ubiquity emerge rapidly mids news discourse become critical time argue ai news reporting important factor building critical data literacy among lay audience,0.0,0.741592760164884,0.0,0.14803977140399116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044080479635549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2587659342533951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22552628263521804,0.0,0.10594182288069771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572855648264789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08311678880230734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165301166524366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625531141779837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09360333115439369,0.3178254686420931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572855648264789,0.07401988570199558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08794437721107327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832139776445237,0.0,0.0,0.14155659415200664,0.09160698882226186,0.0,0.17588875442214655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14580704480851503,0.0,0.06878195474387148,0.0,0.0,0.08794437721107327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Cybersecurity of the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-021-01399-x,17 May 2021,"Mariusz Pyzynski, Tomasz Balcerzak","In recent years, UASs have become more and more popular. There are many reasons for this; one of the most popular is the enhancement of drones’ functionalities and improvement in battery life, stabilization, navigation, sensor technology, and much more. Many benefits drive growth. However, as the number of drones is expanding and their technological functionalities are evolving, drones’ use brings many concerns and challenges that should not be underestimated. This refers to issues in the area of cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. UASs, under the international, regional, and national regime of aviation law, are considered aircraft. Since there is no existing cybersecurity framework specific to the UASs, the civil aviation cybersecurity framework should apply to their operations. This paper will focus on the potential cyber threats against UASs, providing examples of cyber-attacks from the past. Further, the aviation cybersecurity framework’s overview will follow to determine the current status of maturity at the international, regional (the European Union), and national (the Republic of Poland) levels. The paper’s conclusion will address the proposed recommendations for the UAS and aviation industries to be considered and potential solutions in terms of applying the aviation cybersecurity framework into the operation of UASs.",recent year uass become popular many reason one popular enhancement drone functionality improvement battery life stabilization navigation sensor technology much many benefit drive growth however number drone expand technological functionality evolve drone use brings many concern challenge underestimated refers issue area cybersecurity privacy public safety uass international regional national regime aviation law consider aircraft since exist cybersecurity framework specific uass civil aviation cybersecurity framework apply operation paper focus potential cyber threat uass provide example cyberattacks past aviation cybersecurity framework overview follow determine current status maturity international regional european union national republic poland level paper conclusion address propose recommendation uas aviation industry consider potential solution term apply aviation cybersecurity framework operation uass,0.10340056144390321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041722101030027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06850594042856506,0.12591072634889397,0.0,0.5480058391026018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4613763024303182,0.0,0.0,0.1169349285857548,0.10536311265291631,0.40611730167003285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338698571715096,0.0,0.11433891041605548,0.12269106280826993,0.0,0.0,0.11971011997227682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23942023994455364,0.15700025963736847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11190032618771323,0.09638731488977716,0.11190032618771323,0.10960116782052037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08401895172650113,0.0,0.08401895172650113,0.0,0.0,0.07099483650920557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11433891041605548
Explaining Wikileaks and Julian Assange as structural threats to the liberal ideological hegemony of American foreign policy,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-022-00421-9,29 October 2022,Stuart J. Hooper,"The political persecution of Julian Assange and Wikileaks by the American state is best explained by understanding the classified revelations as threats to the ideological legitimacy of its foreign policy hegemony. I apply Gramsci’s conception of hegemony, as adherence to universalized principles, to American foreign policy, which explains why ideas matter and their role in a hegemonic system. My empirical analysis primarily focuses on Wikileaks’ Collateral Murder video, and I offer three reasons to argue why Wikileaks undermines the hegemonic structure. First, the organization’s revelations, particularly of war crimes, provide evidence that directly undermines and contradicts the central liberal claims of US foreign policy ideology. Second, those leaks have bolstered the construction and legitimation of organic intellectuals within an antiwar movement that can challenge the hegemonic historic bloc. Third, the leaks question the techno-military claims of the military–industrial complex, which argues its technologies conduct smart, safe, and moral warfare.",political persecution julian assange wikileaks american state best explain understand classify revelation threat ideological legitimacy foreign policy hegemony apply gramscis conception hegemony adherence universalized principle american foreign policy explains idea matter role hegemonic system empirical analysis primarily focus wikileaks collateral murder video offer three reason argue wikileaks undermines hegemonic structure first organization revelation particularly war crime provide evidence directly undermines contradicts central liberal claim u foreign policy ideology second leak bolster construction legitimation organic intellectual within antiwar movement challenge hegemonic historic bloc third leak question technomilitary claim militaryindustrial complex argues technology conduct smart safe moral warfare,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16751774386022547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16751774386022547,0.0,0.2273121182425328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19520828798417303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6819363547275984,0.21664761641934008,0.0,0.0,0.2547165799375788,0.0,0.1785786529011014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118379230672447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785786529011014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15566354592032075,0.0,0.15566354592032075,0.0,0.2273121182425328,0.0,0.0,0.20306021521771767,0.16499125169947898,0.0
